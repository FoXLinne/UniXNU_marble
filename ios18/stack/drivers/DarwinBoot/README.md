# DarwinBoot

UEFI XNU loader with packed RAM disk handoff support.

The Mach-O parser accepts arm64 and arm64e MH_EXECUTE kernels, including
the capability bits in the arm64e CPU subtype. XNU initializes pointer
authentication and applies its own chained fixups. MH_FILESET input is
still unsupported by this loader.

UniXNU passes the selected boot entry's arguments to DarwinBoot, which copies
them into XNU's command line and prints `DARWINBOOT: command line:` before
handoff. The top green bar marks `DarwinEnter` before cache maintenance,
MMU shutdown and the branch to XNU. Follow the
[boot argument workflow](https://unixnu.com/xnu/boot-arguments#apply-arguments)
and [green-bar diagnosis](https://unixnu.com/guide/debugging#green-bar).

`ROOT_STAGE_SERVICE_GUID` supplies resident transport enter and resume hooks.
DarwinBoot invokes enter after firmware memory writeback and invokes resume
before firmware services resume. The board reserves the service CPU outside
the OS CPU topology and retains controller ownership and USB descriptors.

A RootStage table with `WaitForHost == 0` supplies disk and kernel memory
handoff data for a normal boot. DarwinBoot exits boot services and enters
the kernel; resident return hooks are used when `WaitForHost` is populated.

The optional `kernel.macho.vroot` sidecar carries up to 128 MiB of signed root
policies. The loader checks its envelope and supplies its physical range as
`/chosen/memory-map/RootPolicies`. XNU authenticates the policies using an owner
anchor compiled into the source storage runtime. This handoff is independent
of the Data RAM disk, GPU addon and Apple trust cache. The new handoff has not
yet been built or exercised.
