//! The committed prose cites no design record, work package or plan item.
//!
//! `AGENTS.md`: code, comments and docs cite no design-record entries, work-package codes or
//! TODO section numbers, and the tree keeps no plan, status or journal. The authored cases'
//! `rationale` and `no_effect`, and a refusal record's `detail`, are prose a reader meets, so
//! the rule reaches them. None of the three is part of any identity, cache key or validity
//! rule (`computed_case_id` hashes `AuthoredCase::semantic`, `computed_input_sha256` its own
//! `Inputs`, and `index::refusal_staleness` reads a refusal's ABI, fingerprint, venue and
//! identity), so this check is over wording alone.
//!
//! The walk reads `corpus/cases` and `corpus/observations` by name and never the corpus root.
//! Do not widen it to the root as a tidy-up: `corpus/local/` is a private corpus that is not
//! ours, is gitignored, and is never read by a test, committed or regenerated on our
//! initiative. A walk of the root would read it wherever it exists and pass in a tree where it
//! happens to be absent, which is a test passing for the wrong reason.
//!
//! The vocabulary below was taken from a census of every code-shaped token in the committed
//! prose, not a sample: a sample is what once hid `STATUS wave 11 owes this reading` behind a
//! `TUS wave` that matched nothing. `CONTENT` holds the tokens that look like codes and are
//! not, so a true citation cannot be waved through by widening the pattern.
