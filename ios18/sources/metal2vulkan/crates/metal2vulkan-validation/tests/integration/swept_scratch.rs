//! Where a lane's shader cache lives, and why that is the whole of the fix.
//!
//! A [`ScratchCache`] is removed when it drops, which covers a return and an unwind and covers
//! neither a kill nor an exit that runs no destructor -- and lane processes are killed: a run gets
//! cancelled, and the memory cap kills a worker and its whole process group. The caches used to be
//! `$TMPDIR/m2v-lane-shader-cache-<pid>-<n>-<nanos>`, named for a process and recognisable to
//! nothing, so each one a killed lane left stayed there for good: 900 to 2200 of them on a host.
//!
//! The fix is not a second removal somewhere; it is the path. A cache in the project's scratch
//! root carries a lock the kernel releases when its owner dies, so the next run of any suite
//! removes it, and removes no live run's
//! ([`metal2vulkan_devtools::scratch`], whose own tests hold the sweep itself).
