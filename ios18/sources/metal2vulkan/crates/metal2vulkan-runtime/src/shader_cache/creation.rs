//! What a render pipeline state's creation works out from its descriptor before its compile,
//! kept by the descriptor's key, in the device's memory and in the cache directory.
//!
//! A creation decoded and specialized its stages' AIR to answer Metal's linked-use refusals
//! (`RenderPipelineDescriptor::{vertex_returns_value, fragment_writes_depth_unattached,
//! stages_using_direct_arguments, unwritten_fragment_inputs}`), to learn the key its pipeline
//! is found by (`Device::render_variant_key`), and, where asked, its reflection: 18 to 23 ms of
//! a creation of the consumer's heaviest states on the RTX 5080 Laptop GPU's host made again in
//! the same process, and most of the 33 to 39 ms of one in a new process over warm caches, where
//! Metal answers in under 1 ms.
//!
//! - **Keyed by everything the answers read.** Each answer is a function of the descriptor and
//!   the device alone: `Device::render_descriptor_key` digests every field of the descriptor
//!   (each `Function` stage by its compile key: AIR hash, entry, constants, linked functions and
//!   dynamic libraries) with the device's profile fingerprint and `SEMANTICS_VERSION`. A
//!   variant's keys are kept per variant key too ([`VariantStages`]): its pipeline's, and its
//!   stages' functions', which a later creation finds and links with no stage decoded. The
//!   creation's budget decides only whether an
//!   answer comes at all: a refused answer (a deadline, a cancellation, a decode's error) is not
//!   kept, so the next creation asks again.
//! - **And by more than they read, which costs a sweep a trip each.** The key is every field,
//!   where the four answers read only some: the stages, `rasterization_enabled`,
//!   `support_indirect_command_buffers`, the two call-stack depths, whether `depth_format` names
//!   an attachment, and each color attachment's format, write mask, `blending_enabled` and four
//!   blend factors (`reflection::linked`'s `fragment_output` and `writes_depth_unattached`). So a
//!   sweep that moves a field none of them reads -- a vertex descriptor's formats, strides or
//!   step functions, the topology class, the sample state -- asks the directory for a sibling's
//!   answers and works them out again, for an answer identical to the previous sibling's. A
//!   sweep that moves a write mask or a blend factor is **not** such a case: a fragment color
//!   output is kept or dropped by its attachment's mask, format and blending, so those answers
//!   really can differ between siblings and the key must hold them. Narrowing the key is the
//!   translator's to do, beside `render_descriptor_key` and under the same discipline (a field
//!   added to the descriptor must not compile until the key decides about it); doing it here,
//!   from the runtime's reading of which fields the translator's analysis happens to touch,
//!   would break silently the next time it touches one more.
//! - **In memory first, then the directory.** A lookup asks the device's maps, then the
//!   directory's entry (kept in the maps when found); what a creation works out goes to both.
//!   The entries live in the build's directory like the artifacts, so a build never reads
//!   another translator's, under names of their kind, key, profile and the runtime's
//!   `RUNTIME_VERSION` ([`record_name`]): they are the runtime's derivation from a descriptor,
//!   which the build's identity (the translator's) does not cover, so a runtime whose version
//!   moved reads none of them. The answers and the reflection are
//!   the translator's frames (`LinkedUseAnswers::to_bytes`,
//!   `RenderPipelineReflection::to_bytes`: versions, kind, key, profile and checksum checked); a
//!   variant's keys are a record of its own name and the keys under a SHA-256 checksum. A
//!   lookup counts in no statistic but a refused or unreadable entry, and a write in none but a
//!   failed one: they are not translations found, compiled or written. The write itself is the
//!   device's cache thread's, as an artifact's is (`store.rs`, `worker.rs`).
//! - **Bounded.** Each map keeps at most [`ENTRIES`] entries, the least recently used going first
//!   ([`Lru`]); the directory's entries go as every entry does, past its cap. They hold digests,
//!   small answers and reflections, and no AIR, library, or Vulkan object.
