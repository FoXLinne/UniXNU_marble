//! The programs of released pipeline states that records the GPU wrote still run.
//!
//! - **What Metal runs** (an M3 Max on macOS 27, plain Metal, a kernel encoding a compute command
//!   through an argument buffer that names a state made with `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`). A
//!   GPU write of a pipeline state ID resolves the ID as it runs, to the state that took it last,
//!   released or not: a state released before the write, its ID taken by no state since, runs.
//!   The record runs that state's program, and its `getPipelineStateUniqueIdentifier` answers
//!   that state's, from then on: after the program releases the state, after another state takes
//!   the ID, and after four rounds of 48 states took the ID and gave it back. A write of an ID
//!   another state took before the write runs that state.
//! - **The runtime.** A record holds the ID alone, and names the state that held the ID as the
//!   GPU last could write the buffer's records (`IndirectCommandBuffer::window_holder`, which the
//!   getter answers too). A buffer the GPU may write keeps, from its first such write
//!   (`IndirectCommandBuffer::gpu_write`), the program of each state made with
//!   `supportIndirectCommandBuffers` the program releases since ([`Keepers::released`]), and a
//!   blit's copy of commands keeps in its destination the source's kept programs and those of
//!   the released states the CPU set on the commands it copies: a record naming the ID runs that
//!   program where the state held the ID then. Nothing is kept for a buffer the GPU never writes,
//!   so a program that writes no records on the GPU keeps nothing.
//! - **Bounded.** A buffer keeps an ID's last [`PIPELINE_HOLDERS`] released programs, as the
//!   device keeps its last holders: a fifth drops the oldest, whose records then run nothing,
//!   announced (below). So what the buffers keep is at most four programs per pipeline state ID
//!   the program used, each one `Arc` the buffers share: with plain allocation, which hands out
//!   the lowest free ID as Metal does, four times the peak count of live states made with
//!   `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`, however long the program makes and releases them; each ID a
//!   placement (`PipelineOptions::placement`) names besides counts four more.
//! - **Not kept** (`Degradation::ReleasedCommandState`, the command running nothing): the program
//!   of a state released before any buffer whose records the GPU writes naming its ID could be
//!   written, which Metal runs where no state took the ID since; and one past an ID's last
//!   [`PIPELINE_HOLDERS`] holders.
