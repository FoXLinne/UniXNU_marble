//! A queue Metal stops serving after GPU errors its command buffers caused.
//!
//! Measured on the M3 Max with macOS 27.0.1 (about sixty command buffers over five runs; each a
//! blit, a pass of one draw of primitive type 9, a blit, an event signal and a blit, then one
//! committed at once, one committed some milliseconds on, and one committed after the first
//! completed, on queues used in turn):
//!
//! - **Caused errors count, per queue.** A command buffer that fails with
//!   `MTLCommandBufferErrorPageFault` (3) or `MTLCommandBufferErrorTimeout` (2, a GPU hang)
//!   counts against its queue. One that fails as a victim of the GPU's recovery
//!   (`MTLCommandBufferErrorInternal`, "Discarded (victim of GPU error/recovery)") does not:
//!   three on one queue, and a victim then a fault, left the queue serving.
//! - **The second one revokes the queue.** Once the queue's second command buffer with a caused
//!   error completes (two faults, two hangs, a hang then a fault), every command buffer committed
//!   on the queue after that fails at its commit: `Scheduled` and completed 0.02 to 0.06 ms after
//!   its commit, with status `Error` and `MTLCommandBufferErrorAccessRevoked` (4, "Ignored (for
//!   causing prior/excessive GPU errors)
//!   (00000004:kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorSubmissionsIgnored)"); none of its work runs, none
//!   of its event signals fires, and its GPU and kernel times span nothing. Two seconds on it was
//!   so still. One committed before that completion, 4.5 ms into the second fault, ran; one
//!   committed 0.5 ms after it, and later ones, did not.
//! - **Other queues serve on.** A new queue of the same device ran normally after others were
//!   revoked, its own first fault or hang leaving it serving.
//! - The second faulting command buffer itself answers as the first did (its other encoders ran
//!   in 9 of 11 runs, nothing of it in 2), as does one committed at once after it.
//!
//! The runtime counts the command buffers of a queue that complete with a failure of its own
//! making that Metal's GPU causes: [`CommandBufferError::PageFault`] as the runtime fails an
//! encoder Metal's GPU faults (a draw of primitive type 9 over indices, a render encoder's
//! execution of an indirect command buffer under a state it cannot inherit), and
//! [`CommandBufferError::GpuHang`]; and one a program commits as failed in their place
//! (`CommandBuffer::commit_failed`, [`CommandBufferError::Injected`] of Metal's code of either,
//! 3 or 2), which stands for what Metal's GPU caused. Of the other codes it counts none: a
//! victim's (1) does not count on Metal, and the rest are not caused GPU errors or not measured.
//! A failure the driver relays is the driver's own queue's, which Metal counts itself under
//! MoltenVK. From the completion of the second one, before its
//! status reads final, the queue is revoked: a command buffer committed on it then fails with
//! [`CommandBufferError::AccessRevoked`] as its commit's work, from its first encoder, its event
//! signals dropped (`commit_now`). One committed before runs as committed, whatever its event
//! waits (Metal's answer for one held by a wait across the revocation is not measured).
