//! Protection options (`setProtectionOptions:`, SPI) as Metal's GPU answers them, measured by a
//! consumer on an M3 Max (macOS 26.7) over every option below 0x10, 0x10 to 0x100, 0x11, 0x13,
//! `u32::MAX`, `1 << 63`, `u64::MAX - 1` and `u64::MAX`. The runtime has no protected content;
//! what Metal does with the options, it does.
//!
//! - **An encoder made under options other than 0** runs nothing, nor does any encoder after it,
//!   and the command buffer fails with [`CommandBufferError::ProtectedEncoder`]: code 16
//!   ("Protection Violation") below 0x10, 1 (`MTLCommandBufferErrorInternal`, "Invalid Input")
//!   from 0x10 up, none of its event signals firing. An encoder made before the options runs.
//! - **Options from 0x10 up** fail it so with no encoder made under them too, every encoder
//!   running.
//! - **Options 1, 3 and 7** end the process where a compute or render encoder is made under them,
//!   and at a blit encoder's first command (SIGABRT, no message): `Invalid`,
//!   [`Problem::ProtectedEncoder`].
//! - **Refused**: the call while an encoder is open, as Metal asserts
//!   (`exec_protection_envelope_open_encoder`; `Problem::EncoderOpen`), and after the commit;
//!   options changed once an encoder was made under some, or after options from 0x10 up, and a
//!   resource state encoder made under 1, 3 or 7, none measured
//!   ([`AppleOnly::ProtectedContent`]).
