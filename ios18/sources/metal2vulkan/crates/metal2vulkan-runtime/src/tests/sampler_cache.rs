//! What a sampler state's cache of Vulkan samplers (`sampler::KeptSamplers`) is asked for, and
//! what it does with it: how many distinct Vulkan sampler descriptions one Metal sampler state
//! has, and the binds that then find a sampler kept, make one, or forget one.
//!
//! # Why these are counts
//!
//! A bind that finds its sampler kept costs a hash of the description; one that does not costs a
//! `vkCreateSampler` and, where the cache was full, a `vkDestroySampler` with it --- a driver's
//! object making and release, the work the counts of `churn_counts.rs` exist to name. So what the
//! cache is worth is how many binds it answers, and the assertions here are counts of those: facts
//! of the structure that hold on any host under any load, that need no quiet host, and that depend
//! on nothing that ran before them in the process.
//!
//! The descriptions are the real ones, read through `bind::sampler_desc` over every committed
//! device profile (`validation/profiles`), so the count of a state's descriptions is a fact of the
//! translator's sampler rules and not of a case written here.
