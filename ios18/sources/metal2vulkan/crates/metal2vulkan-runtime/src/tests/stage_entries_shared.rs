//! A run of compute pipeline creations over one kernel specializes its AIR **once**, however many
//! siblings the run makes (`WorkCounts::stage_entries_specialized`, `stage_entries_shared`), as a
//! run of render creations over one vertex-and-fragment pair does.
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! A sibling pipeline of one kernel differs only in its stage-input descriptor, which is its
//! lowering inputs: its function compiles again, under its own compile key, so no memo of compiled
//! functions can spare it. What the siblings share is everything the compile does *before*
//! lowering -- decoding the library's AIR, cross-checking the container, binding the function
//! constants, resolving the linked functions, inlining and running SCCP -- which the kernel's
//! descriptor and its call-stack depth alone decide. The device holds that specialized entry
//! ([`StageEntries`](metal2vulkan::pipeline::StageEntries)), so the second sibling onwards reads
//! it rather than decoding and specializing the kernel again.
//!
//! The assertion is a count of specializations, never a time: it is a fact of the structure, so it
//! holds on any host under any load, needs no quiet host and depends on nothing that ran before it
//! in the process (the warm-up's own creation is subtracted). Both halves are needed. The count of
//! specializations holds the sharing from above; the count of **shader modules** holds it from
//! below, because sharing an entry would also read zero if the run never compiled at all -- a
//! sibling found whole in the pipeline memo asks for no entry, and a test that only counted
//! specializations would pass on a run that did nothing.
//!
//! The device takes a shader cache directory of its own, empty, so that no run of this test reads
//! a pipeline an earlier run stored: a sibling found whole on disk compiles nothing and asks for
//! no entry, which is the warmth this count must not depend on.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The kernel is the owned fixture
//! `validation/fixtures/public/engine/kernel_stage_in.ll`'s `stage_in_fetch_wide` (`llvm-as`).
