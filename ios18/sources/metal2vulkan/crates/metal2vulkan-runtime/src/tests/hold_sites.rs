//! Where the scheduler holds a committed batch, and for how long
//! (`WorkCounts::heads_held_for_earlier_commits` and kin, `WorkCounts::batch_hold_nanos`).
//!
//! `commit` submits nothing, as Metal's returns before its command buffer is scheduled, so the
//! time between a commit and its `vkQueueSubmit` is the scheduler's: a look of its for the next
//! batch to submit either takes a head or leaves it, and these counts say which reason left it
//! and what the leaving cost. A consumer that sees a committed command buffer reach Vulkan late
//! reads them to find out where the time went.
//!
//! The hold that crosses queues is the one behind an earlier commit (`scheduler/order.rs`): Metal
//! tracks a resource across queues in the order it schedules the command buffers, so a batch the
//! runtime holds for a reason of its own must not let a later commit's conflicting batch go
//! first. `a_head_that_shares_a_buffer_with_a_held_batch_waits_behind_it` holds one batch by its
//! pipeline's making (the device's pool's test hold, so a making is as slow as the test makes
//! it) and shows both sides of the question: a command buffer of another queue that shares
//! nothing with it goes and is counted as waiting for nothing, and one that writes the buffer its
//! dispatch writes waits behind it and is counted.
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The kernel is `scale_and_offset` of the
//! owned fixture `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll`, as
//! `dispatch_pending.rs` runs it.
