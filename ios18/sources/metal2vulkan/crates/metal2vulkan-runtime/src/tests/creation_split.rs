//! Which part of a pipeline state's creation is the driver's and which is ours
//! (`WorkCounts::render_pipeline_create_nanos`, `compute_pipeline_create_nanos`,
//! `shader_cache_read_nanos`, and `ShaderCacheStatistics`' hits and misses by kind).
//!
//! # Why these are read out here
//!
//! A probe outside the runtime times a creation whole, so it cannot tell the driver's compile from
//! the runtime's own work, and nothing in a `WorkCounts` said how long the driver was in
//! `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` or how long the shader cache's directory was under a creation. This
//! test is the proof that the figures reach a `WorkCounts` through the device's real door
//! (`device/compiles.rs`) and are attributed to the right field. It asserts no magnitude: what
//! they are on a given device is the device's business. That the two driver calls are counted
//! apart is held host-independently against a fake driver in
//! `device::compiles::tests::a_making_s_time_in_the_driver_is_counted_by_the_call_it_made`.
//!
//! # The attribution it holds
//!
//! - **A counted making moved its figure.** A compute state's creation makes its region's
//!   pipeline at the dispatch, not at the creation, so on a device that predicts no region the
//!   sweep here makes none, and on one that does it makes some; either way, where a making is
//!   counted the call's figure must have moved. That direction is what this leg holds, and on a
//!   device that predicts no region it is the render creation below that carries it.
//!   **The converse is not ours to assert.** The figures are the time in *every* making the
//!   runtime asked the device for through the one door (`device/compiles.rs`), and makings that
//!   no `WorkCounts` field counts reach that door too: the device's own answer about a dynamic
//!   binding of several variables, asked inside the first creation whose plan raises the
//!   question and paid for whichever way the driver answers (`pipeline/objects.rs`'s
//!   `takes_multi_variable_dynamic`, a compile this host's driver refuses); priming's kernels
//!   (`device/prime.rs`); and the runtime's own blit, depth, stencil, resolve and plane kernels.
//!   A moved figure therefore names no making, and a creation that made no `VkPipeline` can
//!   still have spent driver time. Counting those makings is not this test's business; until
//!   something counts them, the figure is a cost, not a census.
//! - **A render creation's time is the graphics call's.** It moves the render figure and leaves
//!   the compute figure where it was.
//! - **Every creation asks the directory**, so the reads move in both legs. A creation of this
//!   shape hands every entry to the cache thread, so it writes none itself and the two figures of
//!   its own writes stay at zero together.
//! - **The hits and misses by kind add up to the whole hits and misses**, and a cold compute sweep
//!   misses a compute pipeline's entry while missing no render pipeline's. Without the split, a
//!   creation's one answered lookup and one unanswered one could not be told apart by kind.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`, `m2v_cpu_icd`). The kernel
//! and the function pair are the owned fixtures
//! `validation/fixtures/public/engine/kernel_stage_in.ll` and `ubo_bind_offsets.ll` (`llvm-as`).
