//! A sampler state's cache of Vulkan samplers on a device (`sampler::KeptSamplers`): the
//! descriptions a texture-streaming workload binds one state with, asked of the state itself
//! (`SamplerState::vk_sampler`), are made once and found at every bind after, and the device holds
//! one `VkSampler` per description rather than making and destroying one at each bind.
//!
//! The assertions are counts of what the cache answered and of the device's live samplers, not
//! times: facts of the structure, so they hold on any host under any load (`tests/sampler_cache.rs`
//! says why at length, and measures the same rules without a device).
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects.
