//! docs/API.md's degrade-notice catalogue against the declarations in `degradation.rs`. The
//! catalogue is prose written for a consumer, so it recasts a kind's rustdoc rather than copying
//! it, and most of a declaration's words are no contract: its trigger names the file that lowers
//! the degradation, where the entry names none, and a sentence of either may say in its own terms
//! what the other says in its. Three things the declarations state exactly, which these tests
//! keep:
//!
//! - **The item.** An entry opens with the Rust item it documents, so an entry cannot drift onto
//!   another kind: a runtime kind's [`Degradation`] variant, a note's kind the `PrecisionNote`
//!   variant it announces.
//! - **The cost.** A runtime kind's entry gives, after `Cost: `, the words
//!   [`Degradation::cost`] announces, before whatever more it says. The announced text is a
//!   contract (the stderr line and `DebugMessage::text` carry it), so the catalogue states it
//!   rather than paraphrasing it; an entry may go on past it, which 11 do today. Every note's
//!   kind announces one generic cost, which its entry states in the note's own terms, so a note's
//!   entry is held to its item alone.
//! - **The identifiers of the trigger.** An entry names every
//!   [`metal2vulkan::device::DriverFact`] its declaration's trigger names, and every Metal pixel
//!   format the trigger names in a code span. A consumer predicts a notice from its device's
//!   facts and the format it binds, so dropping one of those names leaves a reader unable to tell
//!   whether the notice reaches them, where dropping a clause of prose does not. Only the
//!   identifiers are held, never the sentence around them; 42 of the kinds are declared with one
//!   today.
//!
//! No rule holds a declaration's prose. Containment of a trigger's first sentence, even with the
//! source-file parentheticals stripped, fails most of the kinds: the catalogue recasts a trigger
//! rather than quoting it, so such a check would read a difference in voice as a defect.
