//! The two predictions a state's creation makes a `VkPipeline` for are counted apart: a render
//! state's predicted key (`pipeline/predicted.rs`) moves
//! `WorkCounts::creation_render_pipelines_made` alone, and a compute state's predicted region
//! (`pipeline/dispatch_making.rs`) moves `creation_dispatch_pipelines_made` alone. The whole
//! count is their sum.
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! The two predictions guess at very different things -- a render key the first draw will bind,
//! and a threadgroup the first dispatch will take -- and they are right at wildly different
//! rates. `creation_pipelines_made` and `creation_pipelines_drawn` cover both, so neither one's
//! hit rate can be read off them: a reading of 100 made and 60 drawn is as consistent with one
//! prediction always right and the other always wrong as with both being right three fifths of
//! the time. Splitting them makes each rate readable, and this holds the split to the kind of
//! state it belongs to.
//!
//! Both legs assert their own count moved before asserting the other's did not: a creation that
//! predicts nothing at all would read zero for both kinds and make the "the other kind did not
//! move" assertion vacuous.
//!
//! # Which compute creations predict at all
//!
//! A compute state predicts a region only where its descriptor states
//! `requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup`, which Metal then makes the threadgroup of every dispatch of
//! the state (`pipeline/dispatch_making.rs`). So the compute leg states one, and a third leg
//! creates the same kernel's state **without** one and holds the kind's count still: a guess at
//! the threadgroup where the request names none was taken by 0 dispatches of 141 made over the
//! whole conformance suite, so it is not made.
//!
//! Every reading here is a delta across one creation on this test's own device, never a
//! device-wide total: a total would be moved by anything else the process did and would pass with
//! the behaviour put back.
//!
//! The assertion is a count, never a time: it is a fact of the structure, so it holds on any host
//! under any load. The device takes a shader cache directory of its own, empty, so no run reads a
//! pipeline an earlier run stored.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The functions are the owned fixtures
//! `validation/fixtures/public/engine/ubo_bind_offsets.ll` and
//! `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll` (`llvm-as`).
