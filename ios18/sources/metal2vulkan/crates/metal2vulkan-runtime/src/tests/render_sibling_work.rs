//! A run of render pipeline creations over one vertex-and-fragment pair, differing only in
//! fixed-function state, makes a `VkPipeline` each and **nothing else**: no shader module, no
//! pipeline layout and no AIR specialization of its own
//! (`WorkCounts::variant_pipelines_made`, `shader_modules_made`, `pipeline_layouts_made`,
//! `stage_entries_specialized`, `functions_translated`).
//!
//! It is the render half of the translation counts: both stages of every sibling ask the device's
//! memo for their function and are answered by it, so one function pair costs one translation a
//! stage however many states the sweep makes (`tests::functions_translated` holds the compute form,
//! where the ask comes from the kernel rather than from a render variant's two stages).
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! A sweep of states over one function pair -- a blend sweep, a vertex-format sweep -- is what a
//! render pipeline state costs when nothing about the shaders changes. Each sibling is its own
//! descriptor, so each needs a pipeline of its own; what it must not need is the work that belongs
//! to the shaders. The stages compile under keys the sweep does not move, so the device's memo of
//! compiled functions answers them; their SPIR-V is word-for-word the first's, so the device's
//! content-keyed modules answer them; their interface is the first's, so its pipeline layout
//! answers them; and their specialized entries are the device's, so no sibling decodes AIR
//! (`tests::stage_entries_shared` holds the compute form of that last one).
//!
//! The assertion is a count, never a time: it is a fact of the structure, so it holds on any host
//! under any load. `variant_pipelines_made` is the floor that keeps a pass from being vacuous --
//! a run whose siblings were all found whole in a memo would read zero for everything, and a
//! sweep that makes no pipeline is not the sweep this measures.
//!
//! `stage_entries_specialized` counts the **device's** entries, so a creation that kept entries of
//! its own would move it not at all and read as perfect sharing. The warm-up's own count is
//! therefore asserted to be above zero before the run, which is what makes the run's zero mean
//! shared rather than uncounted.
//!
//! The device takes a shader cache directory of its own, empty, so no run reads a pipeline an
//! earlier run stored.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The functions are the owned fixture
//! `validation/fixtures/public/engine/ubo_bind_offsets.ll`'s (`llvm-as`).
