//! A command buffer's upload arena clears the bytes of a region that the region's data does not
//! cover, and never a chunk of its own (`upload.rs`).
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! One thing reads a byte of a chunk that nothing wrote: a region whose data is shorter than the
//! region. Its bytes past the data are zero — a table padded to a fixed length reads zero in the
//! slots a command left out, and a region the GPU writes reads zero where it wrote nothing. No
//! reader reaches a byte of a chunk outside a region: a descriptor is written with the region's
//! own offset and length, a device address is the region's, and the host's reads and writes go
//! through [`crate::upload::Upload`], which holds the region's length. The bytes an alignment
//! leaves between two regions are in no region at all.
//!
//! So the arena makes a chunk without a clear and zeroes each region's own tail as it hands it
//! out. That is the same answer for every reader above and strictly fewer bytes written: the
//! regions' tails sum to at most the chunk, where a clear of the chunk wrote every byte of it
//! whether a region took it or not — 4 KiB for the first region of a command buffer, whatever that
//! region held ([`FIRST_CHUNK_BYTES`]).
//!
//! # Why a chunk really does hold the last owner's bytes
//!
//! A chunk is a buffer of the runtime's own, so a parked one of the same making is handed back
//! (`recycle.rs`) with its last owner's bytes in it. `a_regions_tail_reads_zero_over_a_dirty_chunk`
//! fills a chunk with 0xab, lets it park, takes a short region out of the chunk that comes back,
//! and reads **both** sides of the region's end: the tail reads zero, and the chunk past the
//! region still reads 0xab. The second half is what makes the first half evidence. Without it a
//! freshly allocated chunk that happens to read zero would pass the test with the zeroing removed.
//!
//! # The counts
//!
//! `new_buffer_bytes_cleared` is the one counter either form moves, so the fix shows up in it as
//! a smaller number rather than as work moved somewhere the gate does not read
//! (`WorkCounts::new_buffer_cleared`). `a_command_buffers_fixed_clear_is_not_a_chunk` reads it
//! over a sweep of two dispatch counts and two command-buffer counts, which separates the two
//! terms: what a command buffer clears whatever it holds, and what each dispatch adds. The chunk
//! was the first of those, the same 4 KiB at every dispatch count, and it is what this fix
//! removes.
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`, `m2v_cpu_icd`).
