//! A shadowed texture read from two encoders of one command buffer: the second encoder reads the
//! image the first left holding the truth and copies nothing in (`shadow::ShadowCarry`).
//!
//! Metal shows an encoder the bytes as of its command buffer's commit (`shadow.rs`'s copy-in
//! rule), so the second encoder's copy in would move texels the image holds already. This checks
//! both halves of leaving it out on a device: the texels the second encoder read are the buffer's,
//! and the counters say its copy in was left out. A carry that stopped firing leaves the texel
//! comparison passing and the counts wrong; one that fires over an image Vulkan never ordered or
//! left in another layout leaves the counts right and the texels wrong.
//!
//! The texture is [`WIDTH`]x[`HEIGHT`] over a `Shared` buffer, rows of [`ROW`] bytes (not a
//! multiple of 256, so a shadow wherever the device lays no image's rows so), its texels' channels
//! 0 or 255 ([`texel`]) so that `invert_texels`' writes are exact (Vulkan converts 0.0 and 1.0 to
//! 0 and 255 exactly). Two compute encoders of one command buffer each dispatch `invert_texels`
//! over every texel, reading the shadowed texture and writing a target texture of its own: both
//! targets must hold every texel inverted. A binding bounds nothing it reads, so the first copy in
//! moves every texel, and the second encoder's would move them again.
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The function is the owned fixture
//! `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll` (`llvm-as`).
