//! A device's `VkQueue`s are shared round robin among its command queues, and the sharing is
//! counted: the first command queues each take a `VkQueue` of their own, and the one past them
//! takes one an earlier command queue took (`WorkCounts::queues_sharing_a_vk_queue`).
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! Two command queues on one `VkQueue` submit to one Vulkan queue, which runs its submissions in
//! order, so one's command buffers wait for the other's whole command buffer. Metal's queues wait
//! for each other only inside one command: on this M3 Max a side queue's command buffer waited the
//! whole 2.50 s of another queue's single compute dispatch, but nothing at all behind the same
//! 2.50 s split into 256 dispatches of one command buffer (`queue.rs`). The runtime answers that
//! with queues, lending the round robin every queue the device's families have past the two
//! reserved for presenting, up to sixteen (`device/create.rs`); what it cannot answer is a
//! program with more command queues than the device has queues, and on this host MoltenVK's four
//! families of one queue each are four. The count is what makes that visible to a caller rather
//! than left to be inferred from a timing.
//!
//! The assertion is a count, never a time: it is a fact of the device's queue plan, so it holds on
//! any host under any load. The run asserts both sides of the step -- zero sharing up to the
//! device's queues, then one more share per command queue past them -- so a device that shared
//! from its first command queue fails it as surely as one that never counted a share.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects.
