//! Every [`Degradation`] kind has a lane site, held without a device.
//!
//! The validation crate's device test `runtime_lane::degrade_notices::
//! every_kind_has_a_site_a_lane_test_takes` holds the closed vocabulary to the lane's sites, but
//! its module compiles only under `m2v_gpu` or `m2v_cpu_icd`, so a kind that lands with no site
//! leaves that test red where nobody reads it until someone runs the device lane by hand. The two
//! halves of that test are not alike, though: a site's kinds are a `const [Degradation; N]` in its
//! lane module, and the list of sites is a `const` array in the device test's own body, so **the
//! site set is static source data** and only the announcement it stands for needs hardware.
//!
//! So the check splits. This test reads the sites off the lane's sources and the declared kinds off
//! [`Degradation::ALL`], and fails in the ordinary gate, on any machine, when a declared kind is
//! named by no site or a site names a kind the runtime no longer declares. The device test keeps
//! its own half: that each site's work really announces its kinds on a device. Neither replaces the
//! other, and no kind is ever excused from either.
//!
//! A precision note's kind, and `ImplementationDefinedReconvergence`, are taken by a stage's
//! recorded note rather than by a site const, exactly as the device test takes them, so they are
//! held to being declared and to being absent from every site's const.
//!
//! Like `degradation_catalogue` (and as `tests/mod.rs` says), this reads the repository beside this
//! crate, so it runs from the workspace checkout and not from a packaged crate.
