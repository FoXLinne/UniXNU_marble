//! A dispatch encoded over a no-copy buffer's pages whose command buffer is committed behind a
//! shared-event wait, the buffer then detached and rebound before the host signals the event.
//!
//! The wait holds the work unstarted -- a shared event only the host signals holds the batch
//! unsubmitted, as nothing of the GPU's will reach its value (`event_timeline.rs`,
//! `scheduler::event_waits`) -- so the command buffer's first submission comes after the rebind.
//! `rebind.rs`'s rule has the rebind then encode the compute encoder that named the buffer again,
//! in its own call, before that submission (`command_buffer/reencode.rs`): the dispatch writes the
//! pages the buffer lies in then. Where the rebind cannot encode it again, the submission runs
//! nothing and the command buffer fails `CommandBufferError::EncodedUseRebound`
//! (`command_buffer/first_submission.rs`). Either is honest; what neither allows is the dispatch
//! writing the pages it was encoded over while the command buffer reports `Completed` with no
//! error, which leaves the program reading pages it no longer uses and nothing said.
//!
//! The consumer's sequence, which these follow: the buffer made over one page, detached, rebound
//! over a second (the page the dispatch is encoded over), the command buffer committed behind the
//! wait, the buffer detached again and rebound over a third, and only then the event signalled.
//! Each leg differs in which rebind is given a keep-alive ([`Keep`]), the runtime extension that
//! decides whether the import of the pages it hands over is freed in the call or on one of the
//! device's handler threads (`host_memory.rs`): the consumer's own measurement turned on it.
//!
//! The pages are the test's own ([`Page`], freed when dropped), never the keep-alive's, so every
//! leg reads both ranges back whatever it passed: no leg's quiet answer rests on a free.
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The kernel is `scale_and_offset` of the
//! owned fixture `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll`
//! (`output[i] = input[i] * scale + i`), as `dispatch_pending.rs` runs it, in one threadgroup.
