//! What a killed run leaves in the suite's scratch root, and what the next run does about it.
//!
//! A drop guard covers a return, an `?` and an unwind; it cannot cover a kill, and a kill is
//! ordinary here (a cancelled run, the memory cap killing a worker's process group, a wedged Metal
//! shader compile that has to be killed). So the suite's scratch root carries a lock per run that
//! the kernel releases when its owner dies, and the next run removes the directory of every lock
//! it can take ([`metal2vulkan_devtools::scratch`]).
//!
//! This test is that sentence run for real, with three processes:
//!
//! - one run is killed with `SIGKILL` -- its own pid, from [`std::process::Child::kill`], never a
//!   pattern that would reach another stream's processes;
//! - a second run is started **before** the kill and is still live and still holding its lock;
//! - a third run then starts, which is "the next run", and sweeps.
//!
//! The assertion that matters is the third one: the sweep removes the dead run's directory and
//! leaves the live run's, with the file the live run is using still in it. A sweep that cannot
//! tell those two apart would destroy a concurrent run of the suite mid-case, which is why
//! recognition is a lock the kernel answers for and not a name.
//!
//! The three runs are given a temp directory of this test's own, so the scratch root they share is
//! this test's and the run that sweeps a directory of it can only be one of these three. Against
//! the machine's own root, a suite another stream started could be the sweeper instead -- which
//! would say nothing about the mechanism and would fail at random. That temp directory is itself a
//! scratch directory of the real root, so a kill of this test leaks nothing either.
