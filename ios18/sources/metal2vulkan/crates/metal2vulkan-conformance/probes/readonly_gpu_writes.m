// What Metal does with a GPU write into memory whose backing is read-only.
//
// The owner's rule is that where Metal drops such a write we drop it too, on every driver, with no
// refusal. Four points are already measured and written down in
// `metal2vulkan-runtime/src/read_only_view.rs` and `Degradation::PrivateResourceOption`: a blit
// fill completes with no error and is visible to a later command of the SAME command buffer but
// not to a later command buffer; a kernel's stores are dropped; the pages' protection is
// unchanged; and a CPU write through a read-only mapping ends the process. This probe re-measures
// those and then measures the shapes nobody has: a render attachment (colour, depth, stencil), a
// resolve, a visibility result, a draw-stage store, and a store through an address the shader
// loaded out of an argument buffer.
//
// ONE SHAPE PER PROCESS, chosen on the command line, because the owner's own report says Metal
// either drops such a write OR faults, and a fault inside a command buffer holding five shapes
// says nothing about which one caused it. A fault is a legitimate measurement here; it is why
// this is a probe and not a conformance case.
//
// EVERY SHAPE RUNS AGAINST A WRITABLE TWIN OF ITS OWN CREATION PATH, and that control is what
// makes the reading mean anything: "the write was dropped" and "my shader wrote nothing" read
// identically against a read-only buffer alone, and a control made a different way would be
// comparing two creation paths as well as two backing states.
//
// There are TWO read-only states, not one, and the point of the backing list is to compare them:
//
//   plain            newBufferWithBytesNoCopy over the host pages, MTLResourceStorageModeShared.
//                    The writable control for the bit-24 column.
//   bit24            the same with Metal's private MTLResourceOptions bit 24, which
//                    metal2vulkan-runtime names `ResourceOptions::PRIVATE_BIT`.
//   viewed           a read-only alias of the same pages (mach_vm_remap sharing them, then
//                    mprotect PROT_READ), imported by newBufferWithBytesNoCopy with NO bit. This
//                    is what metal2vulkan-runtime does on macOS, so whether it agrees with bit24
//                    is what says the emulation is faithful.
//   descriptor       a no-copy buffer made through the private MTLBufferDescriptor
//                    (setContents:, setLength:, setNoCopy:YES, newBufferWithDescriptor:), which
//                    is how the consuming project makes its own. The writable control for the SPI
//                    column.
//   replaced         that descriptor buffer, detachBacking'd and then
//                    replaceBackingWithRanges:readOnly:YES over the probe's pages. THIS IS THE
//                    CONSUMING PROJECT'S PRODUCTION PATH, and bit 24 is only a validated stand-in
//                    for it where the two agree.
//   nocopy-replaced  the same SPI pair on a newBufferWithBytesNoCopy: buffer, which answers the
//                    open question of whether the creation path matters to the SPI at all.
//   detached         the descriptor buffer detachBacking'd and NOT replaced: the reference leg.
//                    The detached state is already well characterised elsewhere, and without this
//                    leg a dropped write under `replaced` could be the detach's doing rather than
//                    the replace's.
//
// WHAT THE TWO READ-ONLY STATES MEASURED, eight runs a shape (the M3 Max, macOS 27.0.1):
// bit 24 and the SPI pair AGREE on all ten shapes measurable under both -- byte for byte, error
// for error, and flap for flap. So bit 24 is a validated stand-in for the consuming project's
// production path rather than an assumed one. `nocopy-replaced` agreed too, so the creation path
// is irrelevant to the SPI. The detach-only leg did NOT agree: it errors BOTH command buffers on
// every shape, blit fill included, which is how we know the drop under `replaced` is the replace's
// doing and not the detach's.
//
// Depth and stencil are measurable in the bit-24 heap form ONLY, and the reason is measured rather
// than assumed: `detachBacking` responds on MTLHeap and answers NO for a heap of
// `newHeapWithDescriptor:`, Private and Shared alike, because there is no Metal route to a heap
// over the caller's bytes for it to detach -- `MTLHeapDescriptor` answers none of `setContents:`,
// `setNoCopy:` or `setDeallocator:`, and `MTLDevice` does not respond to
// `newHeapWithBytesNoCopy:length:options:deallocator:`.
//
// Two things about the SPI that cost the first shape of this probe its answer, both now handled:
// the selector is TWO-part, `replaceBackingWithRanges:readOnly:`, taking the ranges as one
// `MTLResourceAddressRangeArray` object -- a three-part `...:count:readOnly:` does not exist, and
// its `respondsToSelector:` NO was misread as the OS not offering the SPI; and the replace answers
// NO on an object still ATTACHED, so detachBacking goes first and its own answer is reported
// separately, because otherwise a NO says nothing about which of the two calls refused. The
// device's `supportsResourceDetachBacking` is reported on every run before any of this, so a
// negative result is never confused with an unsupported device.
//
// Each run prints one flat key=value report on stdout: the backing's protections, the buffer's
// own facts, each command buffer's status and error, and WHICH BYTES MOVED in three read-backs --
// a copy taken in the SAME command buffer as the write, a copy taken in a LATER command buffer,
// and the CPU's own view of the pages afterwards. The whole 64 KiB region is compared every time,
// not only the bytes the write aimed at, because for read-only memory the bytes that did not move
// are the result.
//
// Nothing here writes outside the region the probe allocated, and no shape loops. The risk it
// carries is Metal's own: a shape Metal faults on will fault, which is the thing being measured.
