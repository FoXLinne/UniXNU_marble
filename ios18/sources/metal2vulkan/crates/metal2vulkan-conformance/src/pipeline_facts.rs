//! What a pipeline **state** says about itself: `MTLComputePipelineState`'s and
//! `MTLRenderPipelineState`'s own getters, and the descriptor fields each one echoes back.
//!
//! A pipeline state is immutable, so everything it answers was decided by its descriptor or by the
//! function it compiled. That makes each getter one of two kinds of question, and the two are not
//! worth the same:
//!
//! - **a round trip** — `label` and `supportIndirectCommandBuffers` come straight from the
//!   descriptor, `requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup` from a compute descriptor's, and comparing them
//!   is comparing that we kept what the program handed us;
//! - **a fact about the compiled thing** — `staticThreadgroupMemoryLength`,
//!   `imageblockSampleLength` and `imageblockMemoryLengthForDimensions:` are computed from the
//!   function and the attachment formats, and our side computes them itself, by rules
//!   `metal2vulkan-runtime`'s own documentation says were measured on an Apple M3 Max and an
//!   M4. Those are the ones with something to get wrong.
//!
//! # What is left out, and why
//!
//! **A compute state's `maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup` and `threadExecutionWidth` are not here.**
//! They answer the **device's** limits for the kernel, which is the reason
//! [`Side::static_threadgroup_memory_length`] already states at its own site: a venue that answers
//! less is not diverging from Metal, it is a venue with a smaller device, and a transcript has no
//! way to say that of a number. Capping them from the descriptor does not fix it — the answer is
//! still the least of several limits, one of them the device's — so the two stay out and are a
//! named hole rather than a comparison that would fail honestly on a smaller venue.
//!
//! A **render** state's `maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup` is a different question and is here: a
//! drawing state answers 0, which is a constant and not a limit.
//!
//! **`gpuResourceID` is not here.** A resource ID is each host's own number, for exactly the
//! reason [`crate::argument_encoders`] gives for every word an encoder writes, and a recording
//! holds nothing host-specific.
//!
//! [`Side::static_threadgroup_memory_length`]: crate::case::Side::static_threadgroup_memory_length
