//! Where a command buffer's scheduling sits relative to its scheduled handlers: the vocabulary for
//! the one Metal order `runtime_lane::submission_handlers` carries in prose.
//!
//! Metal runs a command buffer's scheduled handlers on a thread of its own, and the order the lane
//! states is that `waitUntilScheduled` returns **only once every scheduled handler returned**,
//! while the status already reads `Scheduled` from the moment the first of them starts. That is a
//! relation between three things — a handler, a status and a wait on another thread — so the whole
//! experiment is one [`Side`](crate::case::Side) call.
//!
//! # Why the shape is safe and bounded
//!
//! A scheduled handler of the probe's **blocks**, which is the only way to read a status "while a
//! scheduled handler runs". It blocks on a channel with a bound ([`HOLD_LIMIT`]), so it always
//! comes out, whatever the probe's own thread does; and it is released by the probe as soon as the
//! probe has its answer. Nothing of the GPU is held by it: the work is one small fill, which has
//! run or will run regardless of what a handler thread does.
//!
//! The wait under test runs on a thread of the probe's own, so a wait that did not return leaves
//! that thread rather than the suite. Where it does not return, the row records that
//! ([`Returned::NotWithinTheWindow`] at the end) instead of hanging.
