//! The timing-coverage census: which calls have a cost case, and which are untimed.
//!
//! A per-call cost table over an unknown fraction of the API is a table nobody can act on, so
//! "untimed" is a number tracked and driven down the way "unrecorded" is. The plan's words: *a
//! census over the public API — which calls have a cost case and which do not. Today the honest
//! answer is "most of it".* This module is what makes that answer a figure instead of a feeling.
//!
//! # Two censuses, because they answer different questions, and one is exact
//!
//! **The suite's own vocabulary** ([`Census::side`]) is exact and needs no guessing. Every call a
//! case can make is a method of [`crate::case::Side`], and a `times` run says which of them the
//! selection actually made. A `Side` call no case makes is a hole in the suite's coverage of its
//! own vocabulary, and the list of them is work to do.
//!
//! **The runtime's public surface** ([`Census::runtime`]) is the question a consumer cares about,
//! and it can only be answered approximately from here. A `Side` call reaches the runtime through
//! our own code, which calls further helpers, so knowing which public method a timed call reaches
//! needs a call graph this crate has no business building. What the census does instead is honest
//! and still useful: it counts the public methods of the runtime's **frame surface** — the objects
//! a frame makes its calls on — and says which are **named anywhere** in the suite's own
//! runtime-side sources.
//!
//! That count is an **upper bound** on timed coverage, and the report says so in those words. A
//! method named in our sources is at most reachable by a timed call; a method named nowhere in
//! them cannot possibly be timed. The gap between the two numbers is the actionable figure, and
//! narrowing the upper bound to a real one is a call graph's job, named as the next step rather
//! than quietly assumed away.
//!
//! The frame-surface list is the one `scripts/api-cost-coverage` already uses for the other
//! harness's table, kept the same here deliberately: two censuses over two different denominators
//! would be two numbers nobody can put beside each other.
