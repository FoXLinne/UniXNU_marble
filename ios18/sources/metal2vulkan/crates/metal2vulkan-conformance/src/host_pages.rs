//! Host pages a case hands the device as a no-copy buffer's bytes, and the read-only state of them
//! whose GPU writes Metal drops.
//!
//! Every other buffer in this suite is the device's own memory. A case here needs the other kind:
//! memory **the program owns**, handed to Metal by
//! `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy:length:options:deallocator:`, because that is the only shape in which
//! a Metal program can say "this memory is read-only" — Metal's private `MTLResourceOptions`
//! bit 24, which `metal2vulkan-runtime` names
//! [`ResourceOptions::PRIVATE_BIT`](metal2vulkan_runtime::ResourceOptions::PRIVATE_BIT). With the
//! bit, the GPU's writes to the memory go nowhere, and matching that exactly on every driver is
//! the owner's standing rule.
//!
//! # Why a case states bytes and a pattern rather than an address
//!
//! Nothing host-specific may reach a transcript, and a host pointer is the most host-specific
//! value there is. So a case states [`HostBufferSpec`]: how many bytes, the byte they all start
//! as, and whether the memory is read-only. The side maps them, fills them and answers a handle.
//! The case then reads the bytes back through
//! [`Side::read_buffer`](crate::case::Side::read_buffer), which is the CPU's own view of the
//! pages, and through a copy the GPU makes into an ordinary buffer, which is the GPU's.
//!
//! # Why the size is a multiple of 16 KiB
//!
//! A no-copy buffer's pointer and length are the host's pages, and the host page is 16 KiB on
//! Apple silicon and 4 KiB on the x86-64 and arm64 Linux venues. A case that stated "four pages"
//! would hand Metal 64 KiB here and lavapipe 16 KiB, and the two legs would then be comparing
//! read-backs of different lengths. So a case states **bytes**, [`PAGE_MULTIPLE`] holds the
//! largest page in play, and a spec whose size is not a multiple of it is refused before any
//! device sees it.
//!
//! # The CPU write is out of scope
//!
//! A CPU write through a read-only mapping ends the process (measured on an M3 Max under
//! macOS 27.0.1). That is Metal's own behaviour, it is not something this project changes, and
//! nothing here writes through such a mapping: [`HostPages::bytes`] reads, and the only write is
//! the pattern the pages are filled with before any read-only state exists.
