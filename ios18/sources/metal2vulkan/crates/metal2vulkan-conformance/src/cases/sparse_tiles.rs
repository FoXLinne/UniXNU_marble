//! `MTLDevice`'s sparse tile getters: the tile a sparse texture maps in, and that tile's bytes.
//!
//! Four Metal selectors, all pure getters:
//!
//! - `sparseTileSizeWithTextureType:pixelFormat:sampleCount:`
//! - `sparseTileSizeWithTextureType:pixelFormat:sampleCount:sparsePageSize:`
//! - `sparseTileSizeInBytes`
//! - `sparseTileSizeInBytesForSparsePageSize:`
//!
//! # Why this family comes first of the sparse ones
//!
//! It is the one sparse family that needs **no sparse-capable device**. The getters compile
//! nothing, allocate nothing and reach no GPU, and neither side asks the device whether it binds
//! sparse memory: the runtime answers from a model of Metal's rule (`sparse::tile_texels`) and
//! Metal answers from its own. So the whole family compares on a venue that has no sparse binding
//! at all, and a lavapipe leg here reports real answers rather than a hole.
//!
//! # What the port adds to the lane
//!
//! `runtime_lane::sparse_textures` asks the runtime for exactly three of these answers, inside
//! three much larger tests, and asserts each against a literal: `(Type2D, R32Float, 1)` and
//! `(Cube, R32Float, 1)` are 64 by 64, and `(Type2DMultisample, RGBA8Unorm, 2)` and `4` are 64 by
//! 32 and 32 by 32. Nothing in the tree ties any of them to a Metal run, and the model's own
//! comment says it was measured on an Apple M4 — a machine that is gone.
//!
//! The rule the model states has two claims a sweep can check and three literals cannot:
//!
//! - **the answer does not depend on the texture type** (`sparse_tile_size_for_page` takes the
//!   type and ignores it, `_texture_type`), which [`BY_TYPE`] asks of every texture type a sparse
//!   heap makes a texture of;
//! - **the tile halves a side as the block's bytes double**, keeping the tile's bytes at the
//!   page's, which [`BY_FORMAT`] asks of formats from 1 to 16 bytes a block and of the
//!   block-compressed families, in all three pages.
//!
//! # Why every case here is safe
//!
//! No case reaches the GPU, allocates or compiles. The one hazard a getter of Metal's can carry is
//! an argument its own API validation stops, which ends Metal's process, and the arguments here are
//! kept to the ones Metal describes a sparse texture of:
//!
//! - the **texture types** are the seven a sparse heap makes a texture of. `Type1D`, `Type1DArray`
//!   and `TextureBuffer`, for which `Heap::new_texture` answers nil, are left out: the model would
//!   answer for them as for any other type, and asking Metal is the only way to find out, but
//!   nothing in the tree says Metal's validation takes them. That is the next query to add, and it
//!   needs its own evidence first.
//! - the **sample counts** are 1 for a single-sampled type, and 2 and 4 for a multisample type,
//!   which are the counts the lane measured on this oracle. A count a device does not hold, and a
//!   count on a single-sampled type, are left out for the same reason.
//! - the **formats** are colour formats and the four depth and stencil formats this chip has.
//!   `Depth24Unorm_Stencil8`, which Apple silicon does not support, is left out.
//!
//! Two guards hold that argument, run on a device: the arguments of every query are inside the
//! shapes above, and the runtime's model answers a real tile for each of them — a query the model
//! has no rule for is one whose Metal answer nothing in this tree can predict. Both run before
//! anybody records, which is what the suite's order of work asks for.
