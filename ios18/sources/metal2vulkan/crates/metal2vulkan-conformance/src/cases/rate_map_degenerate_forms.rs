//! A degenerate screen extent reached by every **other** construction route, each compared whole.
//!
//! Metal's `MTLRasterizationRateMapDescriptor` has four ways to reach one state
//! ([`crate::case::RateMapForm`]), and a program that reaches it one way must get the map it would
//! have got another way. Two halves of this family already say something about that, and neither
//! says this:
//!
//! - [`crate::cases::rate_maps`]'s `rate-map-zero-screen-width` compares a **degenerate** screen
//!   whole — the label, the screen size, the granularity, the layer count,
//!   `physicalSizeForLayer:` of layer 0, `parameterBufferSizeAndAlign` and all 24,624 parameter
//!   bytes — but by **one** route, `rasterizationRateMapDescriptorWithScreenSize:` then
//!   `setLayer:atIndex:`, because it predates the others.
//! - [`crate::cases::rate_map_sweeps`]'s `rate-map-descriptor-forms` compares every route, but at
//!   `space::SWEEP_EXTENT`, where nothing is degenerate.
//!
//! So the crossing was covered by nothing: a route other than `setLayer:atIndex:` reaching a
//! descriptor whose screen has a zero axis. These three cases are that crossing at the shape the
//! covered route was measured at, each compared **whole**, parameter data included:
//!
//! | Case | Route |
//! |---|---|
//! | `rate-map-zero-width-with-screen-size-and-layer` | `rasterizationRateMapDescriptorWithScreenSize:layer:` |
//! | `rate-map-zero-width-with-layer-count-and-layers` | `rasterizationRateMapDescriptorWithScreenSize:layerCount:layers:` |
//! | `rate-map-zero-width-layers-subscript` | `rasterizationRateMapDescriptorWithScreenSize:` then `layers[0] = layer` |
//!
//! **The descriptor is `rate-map-zero-screen-width`'s, to the byte.** The same screen (`0` by
//! `64`), the same single layer (one quality sample of a half on each axis), the same label
//! (`conformance-zero-width`), so the construction route is the only thing that moved between the
//! four. That is what makes the four recordings a side-by-side reading rather than four separate
//! measurements, and it is why the label is shared rather than made unique per case: a differing
//! label would be a second thing that moved, and `facts/label` is one of the compared fields.
//!
//! The route is in each case's **input fingerprint**, which is why these are a module of their own
//! rather than three more rows of [`crate::cases::rate_maps`]: that module's fingerprint states the
//! screen, the layers and the label and not the route, so adding the route to it would have
//! invalidated two committed recordings to say nothing new about either.
//!
//! Our side has one construction path — the runtime's
//! [`RateMapDescriptor`](metal2vulkan::bind::RateMapDescriptor) is a plain struct a consumer fills
//! — so all four cases feed it the same struct and it answers the same map. That is the comparison:
//! every route Metal offers must compile the map our one struct compiles, at a degenerate extent as
//! much as anywhere else.
//!
//! [`crate::cases::rate_map_sweeps`]'s `rate-map-degenerate-form-sweep` is the breadth half of the
//! same crossing: the same routes over all three degenerate screens (`0` by `64`, `64` by `0` and
//! `0` by `0`), comparing every derived answer but not the parameter bytes, which are one fixed
//! size for every map and would hold megabytes of recording to say what these three say.
//!
//! # Why these cases are safe
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the GPU, for the reason [`crate::cases::rate_maps`] gives: a rate map is
//! compiled on the CPU, its getters are CPU reads and `copyParameterDataToBuffer:offset:` is a CPU
//! copy into shared storage. No command buffer is made and no pass is opened.
//!
//! The one call that is **not** safe over such a map is
//! `mapScreenToPhysicalCoordinates:forLayer:`, which is measured to end plain Metal's process with
//! a SIGSEGV over a zero screen extent — on `0` by `64`, `64` by `0` and `0` by `0` alike — and
//! which the runtime refuses for that reason. No case here asks for it, which is the same bound
//! `rate-map-zero-screen-width` keeps.
