//! A command queue's limit on uncompleted command buffers: the first case whose subject is a call
//! that **did not return**.
//!
//! Metal's `commandBuffer` blocks once a queue holds `maxCommandBufferCount` uncompleted command
//! buffers, and answers once one of them is dropped uncommitted or completes. The case records four
//! facts per queue ([`crate::queue_slots::QueueSlots`]): how many makes answered at once, that the
//! next one did not, that it answered once a slot came back, and that another queue's make went on
//! meanwhile.
//!
//! # What it pulls forward
//!
//! `runtime_lane::command_queues` holds Metal's default count as `METAL_DEFAULT: usize = 64`, a
//! constant with the word "measured" beside it and no run behind it. The first row here measures it
//! on the oracle: the default queue's probe makes command buffers until one blocks, up to a cap
//! above 64, so the number in the recording is the number Metal answered rather than the number
//! somebody wrote down. A release where Apple changes it fails the case.
//!
//! # Why it is safe
//!
//! Nothing is committed, so nothing reaches the GPU: the probe makes command buffers, holds them,
//! and drops them. Every make runs on a thread of its own and a blocked one is released by the
//! probe, so no wait here can hang ([`crate::queue_slots::probe`]).
//!
//! **A count of 0 is deliberately not a row.** Metal's own validation ends the process on
//! `maxCommandBufferCount:0` — the runtime says so by answering `Invalid` rather than `Nil` — so no
//! case may ask Metal for it. The runtime's typed refusal of a count of 0 stays a `runtime_lane`
//! assertion, where no Metal run is involved.
