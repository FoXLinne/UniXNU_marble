//! Where a command buffer's scheduling sits relative to its scheduled handlers, measured on Metal.
//!
//! `runtime_lane::submission_handlers` states this order in its module prose — "its status reads
//! `Scheduled` just before its first scheduled handler starts, and Metal's wait for the scheduling
//! returns only once every scheduled handler returned" — attributed to **an M4 on macOS 27.0.1**,
//! a machine this project no longer has. Its test
//! (`wait_until_scheduled_returns_once_the_scheduled_handlers_returned`) then holds the runtime to
//! that sentence with no Metal leg in it. So the number behind the rule is a measurement nobody can
//! re-take there, on a chip that is gone.
//!
//! This case re-takes it on the oracle, with both sides running, and compares six fields:
//!
//! - the status the scheduled handler read of its own command buffer, from inside itself;
//! - the status the probe's thread read while that handler was held inside itself;
//! - whether a `waitUntilScheduled` on a third thread returned while the handler was held — the
//!   rule itself, as a fact that can be false;
//! - what that wait answered once the handler was released;
//! - the status the completed handler read of its own command buffer;
//! - the order the two handlers were called in.
//!
//! # Why holding a handler is the only way to ask
//!
//! Every field above is a statement about a moment **inside** a handler. A status read after
//! `commit` returned would be a race, not a fact: the command buffer may reach `Scheduled` between
//! the two statements, so a case that recorded it would record whichever run came last. Holding the
//! scheduled handler is what makes the window real, and so every field deterministic.
//!
//! # Why it cannot hang and holds no GPU
//!
//! The held handler blocks on a channel with a bound of its own
//! ([`crate::scheduled_handlers::HOLD_LIMIT`]), so it leaves Metal's handler thread whatever the
//! probe does, and the probe releases it as soon as it has its answer. The wait under test runs on
//! a thread of the probe's own and is never joined, so a wait that did not come back leaves that
//! thread and not the suite — the shape [`crate::queue_slots::probe`] already takes for the same
//! reason. The GPU work is one fill of [`crate::event_orders::SCRATCH`] bytes and is independent of
//! every handler thread: no pass, no dispatch, no loop.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! The lane's **submission handlers** (`CommandBuffer::add_submission_handler`) are a runtime
//! extension: Metal has no counterpart, so there is nothing for a conformance case to compare, and
//! which thread of ours runs them is exactly the kind of internal fact the suite keeps out of a
//! transcript. The whole of `runtime_lane::submission_checks` is the same story one layer up
//! (`set_submission_check` is ours alone). Both stay lanes.
