//! What a view of a texture answers about its parent, what each of `MTLTexture`'s four view
//! creators makes, and what a shareable texture's handle opens.
//!
//! The suite already made views, through one selector and always of the parent's whole level and
//! slice ranges ([`crate::texture::Over::View`]) — so `parentTexture`, `parentRelativeLevel`,
//! `parentRelativeSlice` and `swizzle` were never read of anything, and the `newTextureViewWith`
//! family's other three selectors were never sent. This family states the **ranges**, states
//! which selector makes the view, and reads the four getters of every view it makes.
//!
//! # The cases, and what each one would catch
//!
//! - **`texture-view-parents`**: a base texture, a view of levels 1 to 2, a view of slices 1 to 2
//!   of an array, and — the row that matters — a **view of a view**. What
//!   `parentRelativeLevel` counts from there is a real question with two defensible answers: the
//!   immediate parent, or the root of the chain. The runtime models the immediate parent
//!   (`Texture::parent_relative_level` subtracts the parent's own base level), and nothing in this
//!   tree had asked Metal. The base texture's own row is the baseline: a texture that is not a view
//!   answers no parent and 0 for both relative getters. The case also sweeps **every**
//!   `MTLTextureSwizzle` value as a parent's swizzle — each of the six in all four channels, and
//!   each of the six in one channel over the default, twelve parents in all — and reads each back
//!   off a view made by a selector that states no swizzle. That reading is Metal's choice between
//!   the parent's swizzle and the default, so it is the one place in the suite where the swizzle
//!   enum is compared value by value rather than at one representative.
//! - **`texture-view-selectors`**: the same whole-texture view through all four selectors, and the
//!   same sub-range view through the three that can state one. Two facts: whether
//!   `newTextureViewWithPixelFormat:` and the `textureType:levels:slices:` form agree over the
//!   whole texture, and what `swizzle` a view made by a selector that states none answers — the
//!   parent's, or `MTLTextureSwizzleChannelsDefault`. The case makes the question answerable by
//!   giving the **parent** a non-default swizzle, so "the parent's" and "the default" are two
//!   different recorded values rather than one.
//! - **`texture-view-descriptors`**: `newTextureViewWithDescriptor:` beside the five-argument
//!   selector over the same five values, at three range and swizzle combinations. This is the only
//!   way the suite reaches `MTLTextureViewDescriptor` at all, and what it records is that the two
//!   paths answer alike — a release where they part fails the case rather than passing under a rule
//!   nobody re-measured.
//! - **`texture-shared-handles`**: `shareable` of an ordinary texture, of a view of one, of a
//!   texture of `newSharedTextureWithDescriptor:` and of a view of **that**; then that shared
//!   texture's `newSharedTextureHandle`, the handle's own `device`, and the texture
//!   `newSharedTextureWithHandle:` opens from it. The runtime models `isShareable` as false for
//!   every view, whatever its parent, which is a claim about Metal with no run behind it.
//!
//! # The positive control, and why this family needs one
//!
//! A view's getters are the shape that could read as a pass while nothing was viewed: a side that
//! answered 0, 0 and no parent for everything would agree with a side that made no views at all.
//! So every table is built so the recorded values are ones nothing else leaves:
//!
//! - **the relative getters are recorded non-zero somewhere.** This module's own tests assert, with no device,
//!   that every table holds a view whose first level or first slice is above 0, and that
//!   `texture-view-parents` holds a view **of a view**. Without those rows the case would record
//!   0 at every site, which is also what a side that ignored the ranges would answer;
//! - **the parent carries a non-default swizzle**, so the two possible answers for a view made
//!   without one are two different values;
//! - **the swizzle sweep moves the view's recorded answer at every row**: measured on this chip
//!   the view inherits its parent's swizzle exactly, at all twelve, so a side answering the
//!   default for an inheriting view differs at eleven of them. The sweep states each value in one
//!   channel as well as in four, which is what tells a per-channel reading from a side that read
//!   one channel and broadcast it;
//! - **`shareable` is recorded both ways**, because the shared-handle table holds an ordinary
//!   texture and a shared one.
//!
//! # The swizzle space, and what of it is a mirror
//!
//! `MTLTextureSwizzle` has six values and all six are swept, but only as the **parent's**: a
//! view's own stated swizzle is read straight back from what the case wrote, so sweeping that is
//! indistinguishable by construction and `texture-view-descriptors` states three of them for the
//! different reason that the descriptor path and the selector path must agree on each. The
//! `MTLTextureUsage` bitfield is the other small space this family touches and does **not** sweep:
//! `usage` reads back what the descriptor said, and the usage bits that decide anything decide it
//! by Metal's validation refusing a call — which ends Metal's process and so cannot be a case.
//!
//! # Why every case here is safe
//!
//! A view holds no memory: the call is Metal's bookkeeping over a texture that already exists, it
//! compiles nothing, allocates no texels and reaches no queue. The textures are 64 by 64
//! `RGBA8Unorm` of four levels, and the array ones four slices of that; nothing here dispatches,
//! draws, blits or commits.
//!
//! The one hazard a view creator carries is a range or a format Metal's validation stops, which
//! ends its process. [`crate::texture_views::ViewRequest::is_well_formed`] decides that from the
//! request's own shape and the parent's, this module's own tests hold every row of every table to it with no
//! device, and the Metal side calls it in the one place that makes a view — so a row somebody adds
//! to a recorded table by mistake is refused by the side rather than by a convention.
//!
//! `newSharedTextureHandle` is asked **only of a shareable texture**. What Metal does for one that
//! is not is unmeasured: the runtime models nil, and a case that asked and was wrong would end
//! Metal's process. It is named here as an open hole rather than probed.
