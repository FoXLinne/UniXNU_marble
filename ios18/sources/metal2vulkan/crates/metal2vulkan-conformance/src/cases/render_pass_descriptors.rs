//! What a render pass descriptor says about itself, swept over its option space.
//!
//! `MTLRenderPassDescriptor` was exercised at ten of its seventeen items and
//! `MTLRenderPassAttachmentDescriptor` at six of twelve, every one of them by a render family
//! **handing the descriptor to an encoder**. Nothing read one back, so the array length, the
//! imageblock sample length, the threadgroup memory length, the rate map, the sample-position
//! getter, the six index fields of every attachment and the colour-array setter were reached by
//! nothing at all — and the fields that *were* reached were reached at one value each.
//!
//! [`crate::pass_descriptors`] holds the vocabulary, the sweeps and the argument about what each
//! shape can catch. This module is the cases.
//!
//! # The cases, and the depth of each
//!
//! A ratio below is **values compared over values the type has**, on this family's oracle.
//!
//! - `pass-descriptor-defaults`: a fresh descriptor, read whole — all eight colour attachments,
//!   both aspects, the eight numbers, the rate map, the visibility buffer and the sample
//!   positions. The one shape that says what a program gets for free, and (by the measurement in
//!   [`crate::pass_descriptors`]) the one shape that cannot catch a crossed getter.
//! - `pass-descriptor-set`: every field of all ten attachments and all eight numbers stated, no
//!   two alike, read whole. This is the shape that catches a crossing: 60 index fields holding 60
//!   different numbers, ten different (load, store) pairs, three clear colours apart in all twelve
//!   channels, and the depth and stencil clears and filters away from their defaults.
//! - `pass-descriptor-assigned`: attachment descriptors built apart from the pass, stated, assigned
//!   into it and then mutated through the object that was assigned. What the pass answers says
//!   whether `setObject:atIndexedSubscript:`, `setDepthAttachment:` and `setStencilAttachment:`
//!   **copy** the descriptor or keep the caller's — the one way the array's setter can be compared
//!   at all, since the runtime's counterpart is an assignment into a value.
//! - `pass-descriptor-cleared`: the same, then every attachment set to nil, read whole: what a pass
//!   answers for an attachment a program has cleared.
//! - `pass-attachment-actions`, 18 rows: the load action, the store action and the store action
//!   options, **36 of 36 triples** — every `MTLLoadAction` against every `MTLStoreAction` against
//!   both options, exhaustive, because each row states three attachments at three places of the
//!   space ([`crate::pass_descriptors::action_rows`]). Load 3/3, store 6/6, options 2/2 of the
//!   values Metal defines — the mask's undefined bits are not swept, for the reason
//!   [`crate::pass_descriptors::Actions`] gives.
//! - `pass-attachment-filters`, 6 rows: 6 of 6 pairs. Depth filter 3/3, stencil filter 2/2.
//! - `pass-attachment-indices`, 8 rows: the six index fields at 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, the last 32-bit
//!   index, the first value past 32 bits and the last `NSUInteger`. A 64-bit space, so the ratio is
//!   the eight values named rather than a share, and the two above 32 bits are what a side holding
//!   an index in a `u32` fails.
//! - `pass-clear-colors`, 6 rows of four channels: 24 doubles including a NaN with a payload, both
//!   infinities, both zeros, a denormal and the largest and smallest finite doubles.
//! - `pass-clear-depths`, 13 rows: both ends of the documented `[0, 1]`, the middle, a value either
//!   side of each end, both zeros, a NaN of each sign, both infinities, a denormal and the double
//!   just below 1.
//! - `pass-clear-stencils`, 262 rows: **every one of the 256 bytes**, exhaustive, and six words
//!   above them. 256/256 of the byte space.
//! - `pass-numbers`, 36 rows: each of the pass's eight numbers at 0, 1, its documented limit and
//!   the value either side of it ([`crate::pass_descriptors::NUMBER_SWEEPS`] says which limit is
//!   which).
//! - `pass-sample-positions`, 4 rows: no positions at all, four exact sixteenths, two positions,
//!   and four coordinates that are not sixteenths. 2 of the sample counts an Apple GPU takes custom
//!   positions at, and the fourth row is what says whether the getter answers the value a program
//!   gave or the one the rasterizer would use.
//!
//! # What is swept and what is not, with the reason
//!
//! - **The textures are not.** An attachment's `texture` and `resolveTexture` are read as whether
//!   the descriptor holds one, and no shape states one: what Metal renders through a texture at a
//!   level and a slice is every other render family's subject, and Metal checks none of these
//!   fields until an encoder opens.
//! - **The rate map and the visibility buffer are not**, for the same reason from the other end:
//!   each is an object whose identity nothing here compares. Both getters are read.
//! - **Sample positions outside `[0, 1)` are not**, nor more positions than a sample count: Metal
//!   documents and asserts on both, and [`crate::render::forbidden_positions`] is the suite's one
//!   guard for it, which this family's Metal side calls before the setter.
//! - **`sampleBufferAttachments` is not**: counter sample buffers are a runtime gap
//!   (`RuntimeGap::CounterSampleBuffers`), so the coverage map does not hold the item and there is
//!   nothing of ours to compare.
//!
//! # What the oracle answered
//!
//! Measured on an Apple M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1 (26A434), which is every recording here, and
//! each of these was an open question in the tree before:
//!
//! - **The three attachment setters copy.** A colour attachment assigned into slot 3 with
//!   `setObject:atIndexedSubscript:`, and a depth and a stencil attachment assigned with their own
//!   setters, keep the values the object held **at assignment**: mutating that object afterwards
//!   does not reach the pass. The runtime's counterpart is an assignment into a value, which copies
//!   by construction, so the two agree — but that they agree is now a measurement rather than an
//!   assumption about `NSCopying`.
//! - **An attachment set to nil answers a fresh descriptor**, not nil: every field of all eight
//!   colour attachments and of both aspects is back at Metal's default, and the pass's own eight
//!   numbers and its sample positions are untouched. This is also what makes the shape safe at all,
//!   since `objc2-metal` 0.3.2 would panic on a nil here.
//! - **Nothing in the descriptor is normalized.** All 36 action triples, both resolve filters, all
//!   262 stencil clear words, all 13 clear depths (both NaNs, both infinities, a denormal and the
//!   values outside `[0, 1]` among them), all 24 clear-colour channels and all 36 pass numbers came
//!   back exactly as they were set, the values past each documented limit included. A descriptor
//!   stores; the checking happens when an encoder opens.
//! - **An index field is a full 64-bit `NSUInteger`.** `level`, `slice`, `depthPlane` and the three
//!   resolve indices keep `0xffff_ffff`, `0x1_0000_0000` and `u64::MAX`, so a side holding one in a
//!   `u32` answers a different number.
//! - **`getSamplePositions:count:` answers the positions verbatim**, including coordinates that are
//!   not sixteenths (0.1 comes back as 0.1): the quantization the rasterizer applies is not applied
//!   to the descriptor. A count of 0 answers how many the pass holds, and setting an empty array
//!   takes the custom positions back off (a count of 0 afterwards).
//!
//! # Exactness
//!
//! Every value is a number, a bool, an ordinal or a float by its bits, so the family declares no
//! tolerance and announces nothing. The clears and the sample positions are compared **by their
//! bits**, which is why a NaN's payload and a signed zero are part of the sweep rather than a
//! rounding question.
//!
//! # Why this family is safe
//!
//! No case makes a library, a texture, a pipeline, a command buffer or an encoder. Each makes
//! descriptor objects, reads them and drops them, so nothing can fault the device, trip its
//! watchdog or reach a queue. The two hazards in reach are named in
//! [`crate::pass_descriptors`]: the sample-position assert, which the guard stops, and
//! `objc2-metal` 0.3.2's non-null attachment accessors.

// third vocabulary beside the two the sides already have would be a third thing to keep in step.
// That is right for the value a row feeds, and it leaves the row's **site name** saying
// `load-0-store-4`, which names no Metal value a reader or a census could recognise. These four
// functions close that: each is a match over the runtime's own enum — one of the two vocabularies,
// not a third — from the ordinal the row holds to the SDK enumerator the ordinal **is**, and the
// site is named after it. So a diff names the value Metal was asked for rather than a number, and
// the enumerator is in the compared text, which is the only place the option-space census can read
// it from. A value whose ordinal no sweep reaches has no name here to go unused: the sweeps are
// exhaustive over all four types, which `tests::every_swept_action_and_filter_is_named` holds.
