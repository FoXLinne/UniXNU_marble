//! A render state's texture slots and how its functions access them, ported from
//! `runtime_lane::texture_accesses`.
//!
//! The question is Metal's reflection: what
//! `newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor:options:reflection:error:` states about the texture
//! arguments of a vertex function (one `access::read` texture at 0) and a fragment function
//! (`access::read` at 0, `access::write` at 1, `access::read_write` at 2, an array of two
//! `access::write` at 3, an `access::write` at 5 the function never references, and a sampled
//! texture at 6). The runtime answers it through `RenderPipelineState::texture_access`.
//!
//! **Why this port was worth doing first.** The lane holds Metal's answers in its module
//! documentation and nowhere else: a prose list, measured on an Apple M4 under macOS 27.0.1, with
//! the lane's own `want` table written to match it by hand. Nothing ties that table to Metal.
//! Here record mode asks Metal itself, on this M3 Max, and the recording holds Metal's per-slot
//! answer as a value; the table stops being a comment somebody has to keep in step.
//!
//! **One stage at a time.** Metal states its reflection as one binding list per stage, so a single
//! `MTLRenderStages` bit has a Metal answer and the case asks for one bit at a time — vertex,
//! fragment, tile, object and mesh. The lane also asks the runtime about a *union* of stages and
//! about no stage at all; those answers are a composition rule of our own API with no Metal
//! counterpart, so they stay in the lane and out of the transcript.
//!
//! **Why the shader is a fixture and not the lane's AIR text.** The lane carries the functions as
//! an inline opaque-pointer AIR string. `xcrun metal-as` assembles that text and `xcrun metallib`
//! packages it once a target triple is added — but Metal then refuses the pipeline with "Failed to
//! upgrade function bitcode" (verified on this M3 Max), so the lane's text cannot be put in front
//! of Metal's compiler at all. The case therefore names the owned fixture
//! `reflection/texture_accesses`, whose MSL declares the same texture arguments at the same slots
//! and whose generated AIR carries the same `air.texture` metadata, down to the array length of
//! two at slot 3 and `air.arg_unused` at slot 5.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the GPU: a library is compiled, a pipeline state is created, and its
//! reflection is read on the CPU.
