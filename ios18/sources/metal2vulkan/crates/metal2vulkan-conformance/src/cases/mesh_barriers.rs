//! Mesh draws behind a memory barrier: whether a reader draw sees the writer draw's words.
//!
//! Ported from the runtime lane `runtime_lane/mesh_barriers.rs`, whose expectation is a transcript
//! of a Metal probe's printed lines (`PX`, `RESULT`, `CTL`). Metal's answer here is **run**, not
//! copied: the lane's own documentation says its table is what an **M4** on macOS 27.0.1 printed,
//! while the suite's oracle is this M3 Max, so porting the lane and recording it is also the first
//! measurement of this probe on the chip the recording is keyed to.
//!
//! Each row is one pass of one `RGBA32Uint` attachment, 8x8, cleared to zero and stored, and a
//! control buffer of four words, `(1, 1, 1, 0)` from the host. A writer draw covers texel (7, 7)
//! and stores its control words from the mesh stage or from the fragment stage; a barrier over
//! buffers, or over the control buffer, from the writer's stage to the reader's follows; then a
//! reader draw reads the words and draws with them.
//!
//! What a row observes is typed, not printed: the attachment's whole 8x8 as bytes under a layout
//! that reads them as 32-bit words, the texels drawn as a count, the control buffer's four words
//! after the pass as bytes of their own, every call of the pass by the Metal selector it makes,
//! and the command buffer's status and error. The lane folded all of that into one list of
//! formatted strings.
//!
//! The row whose reader is an indirect draw of an object function is a case of its own, so that a
//! refusal at its draw — a refused call stops a run — cannot cost the other six rows their sites.
//! **It is not refused on any device we have:** the claim that an emulating device refuses it
//! (`NotImplemented(MeshShading)`) was true until `bind::mesh_object_arguments_module` landed, and
//! the lane that still said so has been corrected. On MoltenVK 1.4.2 it draws Metal's words.
//!
//! Nothing here can fault a GPU: every grid is one or two threadgroups.
