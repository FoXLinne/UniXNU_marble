//! A two-plane extended-range texture joined into one and split back again.
//!
//! A consumer holds Apple's `RGB10A8_2P_XR10` as two single-plane textures: plane 0 viewed in
//! `BGR10_XR` (or its sRGB twin) and the alpha plane in `ARGB8Unorm`, whose first component is the
//! texel's second byte. The owned fixture `xr_planes` joins the two into a `BGRA10_XR` texture (or
//! its sRGB twin) with `xr_planes_join`, and splits one back into both planes with
//! `xr_planes_split`, one thread per texel, reading and writing `half`.
//!
//! One case per pairing of plane 0's format with the joined texture's — four of them — each
//! holding the bytes of all three output textures. Every input code of every channel occurs once,
//! with the bits Metal does not read set, so a channel the conversion drops or keeps shows up as a
//! texel rather than as a hash.
//!
//! Why this family: it is the one lane of the batch whose committed expectation is Metal's own
//! bytes whole, and it is the first case to read a texture at all. The transcript's byte layout has
//! carried a texture region — level, slice, aspect, sample, origin, size and the two pitches —
//! since the core landed, and nothing exercised it. Each output site here names its texture region,
//! so a diff reads `element [row 11, 27]` of a `BGRA10_XR` level 0 rather than a byte offset.
//!
//! The `BGR10_XR` family is also the first thing a venue can honestly lack: lavapipe has no such
//! format, so the texture call returns the typed refusal and the case's verdict is the venue's gap
//! rather than a pass or a failure.
//!
//! Nothing here can fault a GPU: one compute pass a kernel, three textures each, one thread a
//! texel inside the texture, no loop and no sampling.
