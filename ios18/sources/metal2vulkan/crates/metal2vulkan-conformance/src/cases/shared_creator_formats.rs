//! What `newSharedTextureWithDescriptor:` makes, crossed with the **storage mode** it is asked
//! in: the four padded 10-bit formats, the one extended-range format it answers nil for, and two
//! plain formats as controls.
//!
//! The suite held the shared creator and these formats on two axes that never met.
//! [`crate::cases::texture_views`]' `texture-shared-handles` asks the shared creator for one
//! format, `RGBA8Unorm`, and [`crate::cases::textures`] round-trips 576 to 579 from the
//! **device's** creator. So no case crossed the creator with the format, and no case crossed
//! either with the storage mode at all.
//!
//! # The bug the missing cell would have caught
//!
//! A rule in the runtime claimed `newSharedTextureWithDescriptor:` answers nil for each of
//! `R10Unorm_X6` (576), `R10Unorm_X6_sRGB` (577), `RG10Unorm_X12` (578) and `RG10Unorm_X12_sRGB`
//! (579), where plain Metal makes a shareable texture of each. The probe behind it **ran**: it set
//! `storageMode = MTLStorageModeShared` and recorded the nil that came back, which is the storage
//! mode's nil and is answered for every format alike, while the comment beside it wrote the
//! storage down as `Private`. One attribute of one descriptor, recorded wrongly, held a nil over
//! four formats.
//!
//! So the cell this family adds is not "the shared creator with a padded 10-bit format". It is
//! **the shared creator with a padded 10-bit format at each of Metal's four storage modes**, with
//! the storage mode read back off the texture Metal made. A case that asked only at `Private`
//! would pass today and would still not catch the inverse mistake — a rule that answered nil at
//! `Private` and a texture at `Shared`.
//!
//! # The two cases
//!
//! - **`shared-creator-padded-format-storage`**: six formats by four storage modes, 24 cells. The
//!   four padded 10-bit formats, and `RGBA8Unorm` and `R16Uint` as the **controls**. On an Apple
//!   M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1, plain Metal, the four and the two controls answer alike at every
//!   mode — nil at `Shared`, `Managed` and `Memoryless`, a texture at `Private`, 8 of 8 per cell —
//!   and that is the whole finding: the creator's nil belongs to the mode and to no format.
//!   Without the two controls the 18 nils would read as "these formats are refused somewhere",
//!   which is the reading the removed rule was built on. The runtime's own side of it is
//!   `tests::texture_descriptor::the_shared_creator_makes_a_padded_ten_bit_texture`; this case is
//!   the half that holds it against Metal.
//! - **`shared-creator-extended-range-samples`**: `RGBA16Float_XR` (556) at 1, 4 and 8 samples in
//!   `Private` storage, which is the shared creator's **other** nil. It had the same storage-mode
//!   exposure as the four and was read at `Private` on the same chip and release, where it stands:
//!   Metal makes no texture of it alone, from this creator, at any of the three counts (nil 8 of 8
//!   at each). The controls are the same two formats at one sample, made in the same process, so
//!   the row's nil is the format's and not the case's.
//!
//! Together the two say which of the five formats is genuinely nil at `Private` and which four are
//! not, which is exactly the distinction the misread probe lost.
//!
//! # The two axes, by value
//!
//! The storage axis is swept **exhaustively**: `MTLStorageModeShared`, `MTLStorageModeManaged`,
//! `MTLStorageModePrivate` and `MTLStorageModeMemoryless` are every value `MTLStorageMode` has,
//! and each is asked of every format of the first table. The format axis is the five
//! `MTLPixelFormat` values the shared creator's two nils were ever claimed of —
//! `MTLPixelFormatR10Unorm_X6`, `MTLPixelFormatR10Unorm_X6_sRGB`, `MTLPixelFormatRG10Unorm_X12`,
//! `MTLPixelFormatRG10Unorm_X12_sRGB` and `MTLPixelFormatRGBA16Float_XR` — with
//! `MTLPixelFormatRGBA8Unorm` and `MTLPixelFormatR16Uint` beside them as controls. So the first
//! table is the **cross** of the two: 24 cells, and neither axis read alone would settle which of
//! them a nil belongs to.
//!
//! # What each cell records, and why the storage mode is read off the object
//!
//! - **`made`** — whether the creator answered a texture. Metal's nil and the runtime's typed
//!   `Nil` are the same fact and both record `false` (`made_or_nil`), as
//!   [`Side::makes_texture`] already collapses them for the device's creator. Anything else is our
//!   own refusal and is recorded as one, so a typed error cannot hide inside a `false`.
//! - **`resource`** — every `MTLResource` getter of the made texture, **`storageMode` among
//!   them**. This is the readback the removed rule's probe did not have: the mode the case asked
//!   in is stated in the site's name, derived from the same `HeapTextureQuery` field the input
//!   fingerprint covers ([`HeapTextureQuery::words`]), and the mode Metal gave the object is read
//!   back off the object. A recording whose site says `private` and whose `storage_mode` reads 0
//!   would be loud, where a comment saying `Private` beside a call that asked in `Shared` was
//!   silent.
//! - **`resource-after-handle`** — the same getters of the same object, read a second time once
//!   the handle has been made and a texture opened from it. Reading a getter twice on one object
//!   is only worth a site where something happened between the two readings, and here something
//!   did: whether `newSharedTextureHandle` and `newSharedTextureWithHandle:` leave the texture
//!   answering what it answered is Metal's to settle, and nothing in this tree had asked. The two
//!   sites compare independently, so a release where the second moves fails the case.
//! - **`texture`** — `pixelFormat`, `textureType`, `mipmapLevelCount`, `arrayLength` and
//!   `isShareable` of the made texture, so a cell says Metal made a shareable texture **of the
//!   format asked** rather than of some other.
//! - **`handle`** — `newSharedTextureHandle`, whether its `device` is the device that made the
//!   texture, and the texture `newSharedTextureWithHandle:` opens from it with its extent and
//!   level count. Asked only of a texture the creator answered, which is shareable by
//!   construction: what Metal does for one that is not is unmeasured, and asking would end its
//!   process.
//!
//! # The positive control, and why these tables need one
//!
//! Eighteen of the 24 cells of the first case record `made` false. A side that answered nil to
//! every shared-creator call would agree with all eighteen, so the tables are built so it cannot:
//!
//! - **six cells record `made` true**, every format's `Private` row, each with a texture's getters
//!   and a handle's under it. A side that refused the creator outright differs at six cells and at
//!   every leaf beneath them;
//! - **the two controls run at all four modes**, so "nil at this mode" and "nil for this format"
//!   are two different shapes in one recording rather than one claim;
//! - **this module's own tests**, with no device, hold that both tables name both controls, that
//!   every format of the first table is asked at all four modes, and that the `Private` rows exist
//!   — so a table somebody narrows by mistake fails here rather than passing by testing less.
//!
//! # Why every cell is safe
//!
//! A descriptor is CPU-side bookkeeping: nothing here compiles, dispatches, draws, blits or
//! commits, and the largest texture is 8 by 8 of one level. At most eight textures and eight
//! opened ones exist across both cases.
//!
//! The hazard the shared creator carries is a descriptor Metal's **validation** stops, which ends
//! its process rather than answering nil. Two guards:
//!
//! - [`HeapTextureQuery::forbidden`] decides the descriptor's own stopped shapes from its fields
//!   alone, and this module's tests hold every cell of both tables to it with no device;
//! - the **sample counts** are the rest, and they are why the second case holds one format and not
//!   three. Plain Metal stops a multisample texture of a count the device does not take
//!   ("sampleCount (8) is not supported by device" — 3, 8 and 16 on this chip) from every creator,
//!   **except** that the shared creator answers nil first for a format of which Metal makes no
//!   texture alone. `RGBA16Float_XR` is such a format and was measured nil 8 of 8 at 4 and at 8
//!   samples from this creator; `RGBA8Unorm` and `R16Uint` are not, so a multisample row of either
//!   is a shape nobody has measured from this creator and is left out. `samples_are_measured`
//!   holds that, with no device.
