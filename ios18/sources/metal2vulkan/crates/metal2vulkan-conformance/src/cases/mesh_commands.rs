//! Mesh draws in an indirect command buffer: what commands with pipeline states of their own draw.
//!
//! Ported from `runtime_lane/mesh_commands.rs`'s `cpu_own` row, whose expectation is a transcript
//! of a Metal probe's printed lines. That lane's own documentation says its table is an **M4**'s
//! (macOS 27.0.1), while the suite's oracle is this M3 Max, so running it through record mode is
//! also the first measurement of this probe on the chip its recording is keyed to.
//!
//! The row is an indirect command buffer of two commands the host encodes, over a pass of two
//! `RGBA32Uint` attachments, 8x8, cleared to zero and stored: command 0 sets `mesh_draws`' object
//! pipeline, binds the control words `(2, 1, 0, 0)` at object buffer 0 and draws 3 threadgroups of
//! 4 object threads and 2 mesh threads; command 1 sets its grid pipeline and draws 12 by 4 threads
//! in mesh threadgroups of 4 by 2. Both states are made with `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`, the
//! buffer inherits neither state nor buffers, and the control buffer is made resident for the
//! object, mesh and fragment stages before the execution.
//!
//! What the row observes is typed: each attachment's whole 8x8 as bytes under a layout that reads
//! them as 32-bit words, the drawn texel count, the calls of the pass, and the command buffer's
//! status and error.
//!
//! The second case here is [`unordered_draws`], the lane's racy row: two commands with no barrier
//! between them, whose Metal answer is a **set** of outcomes with the runs behind each.
//!
//! ## What of the lane is **not** ported, and why
//!
//! This lane is the largest of the nine probe-line files, and these rows of it are still the
//! lane's:
//!
//! - **Rows that end Metal's process**: the CPU's mesh draw on a buffer of draws of primitives,
//!   and a pipeline state set on a command of a buffer whose command types hold no draw of its
//!   kind. These are **not** recorded-only material, because there is no answer to carry: Metal
//!   never returned from the call, so the lane's table holds no line for them and the only Metal
//!   fact is "the process ended in this call". That is an outcome kind the suite does not have and
//!   the plan leaves unbuilt on purpose, exactly as `texture_buffer_fills` says of the fill
//!   pattern one byte past Metal's longest. Its shape, written down and unbuilt: a third
//!   `MetalSource` whose recording names the call and says Metal did not return, comparing against
//!   our typed refusal at that site as its own verdict — neither exact (Metal has no value) nor
//!   divergent (Metal has no behaviour to diverge from). Building it means a new verdict, so it
//!   waits for the user's word.
//! - **Rows where Metal's GPU faults**: a kernel's mesh draw on a buffer of draws of primitives,
//!   which the lane records as `status=5` with nothing drawn and no mark written. These *are*
//!   recorded-only material — Metal's answer is written down — but every one of them is encoded by
//!   a kernel, so they wait on the vocabulary below rather than on the safety flag, which the
//!   suite already has.
//! - **Rows a kernel encodes** (`kernel_own`, `enc_own`, `kernel_<kind>_on_<kind>`, `enc_barrier`,
//!   `kernel_reset`): a kernel writes the commands through the buffer's and each pipeline state's
//!   **GPU resource ID**, passed in an argument buffer, with the buffer made resident for writing.
//!   Three calls the [`Side`] vocabulary does not have — the resource ID of an indirect command
//!   buffer, the resource ID of a mesh pipeline state, and a dispatch that makes a resource
//!   resident — each needing an implementation on both sides and a forwarding arm in
//!   `validated::Announcing`. That reaches into `case.rs`, `metal_side.rs` and `runtime_side.rs`
//!   at once, which is the shared core three porting streams are editing, so it is named here and
//!   left. (A resource ID is a device-local 64-bit value and must never enter a transcript; it is
//!   an input to the kernel and nothing else.)
