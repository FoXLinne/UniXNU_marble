//! What one command buffer answers about itself: its two owners, its four timing getters, and the
//! encoder kind nothing else in the suite opens.
//!
//! `MTLCommandBuffer` has twenty-one implemented items and the suite reached thirteen of them.
//! Seven of the eight it did not are here: `device`, `commandQueue`, `kernelStartTime`,
//! `kernelEndTime`, `GPUStartTime`, `GPUEndTime` and `resourceStateCommandEncoder`. The eighth is
//! the protocol declaration itself, which no call site can reach.
//!
//! # Why a time is never recorded, and what is recorded instead
//!
//! The four timing getters answer a `CFTimeInterval` — this machine's clock, in seconds. A
//! recording that held one would be a recording of when somebody ran the suite, and it would
//! differ on its own next run. So nothing here records a time.
//!
//! What is durable is the **shape** of the four answers, and it is a contract a consumer leans on:
//!
//! - each getter answers **zero** on a command buffer that has not completed, so a consumer that
//!   reads one early reads a zero rather than a stale number;
//! - each answers a **positive** number once the command buffer completed;
//! - each interval's end is at or after its start, and the GPU's interval does not begin or end
//!   before the kernel's did.
//!
//! Those are booleans, and a boolean compares exactly on every venue and in every year. A venue
//! whose `GPUEndTime` precedes its `GPUStartTime` records a different boolean and the case moves,
//! which is the point: nothing in this tree watched for that before.
//!
//! # The GPU pair is a `Result`, because one side may have no answer
//!
//! `GPUStartTime` and `GPUEndTime` need the device to write timestamps. The runtime refuses them
//! typed where its queue family writes none, and answers them from the host — announcing
//! `Degradation::GpuTimesFromHost` — where the driver's own timestamps wait for every queue's.
//! So [`CommandBufferFacts::gpu`] holds either the flags or the refusal, and a venue with no
//! timestamps records the refusal rather than four booleans derived from zeros. The kernel pair
//! needs no device at all and is always flags.
//!
//! # Why the two owners are booleans too
//!
//! `device` and `commandQueue` answer objects, and an object's address is not a fact a recording
//! may hold either. What a case can state is the **identity** a consumer depends on: the command
//! buffer's `device` is the device its queue was made on — compared by `registryID`, the number
//! Metal gives a device for exactly this — and its `commandQueue` is the queue object it was made
//! by. Each is one boolean, and an implementation that handed back another device or another queue
//! fails it.
//!
//! # Why it is safe
//!
//! One command buffer of one small blit — a fill of a few bytes of the side's own buffer — is
//! committed and waited for. No shader runs, no draw, no dispatch, no loop, and the wait is
//! bounded. The resource state encoder is opened on a command buffer of its own and ended with no
//! update encoded at all, which maps nothing and takes no heap memory.
