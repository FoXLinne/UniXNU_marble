//! Where a rotated framebuffer-only texture's texels lie: the layout a case states, and the two
//! rules that decide where a texel lands and which strides are safe to ask for.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module, and holds no IOSurface
//!
//! Everything here is **portable**, and deliberately: a case states its plane, a recording holds
//! those words, and a Metal-less venue replays it. The surface itself, its CoreFoundation and
//! IOSurface entry points and the handle that owns one all live in `crate::metal_surface` (private
//! to the suite, so not linked here), which is the only module that makes an `IOSurfaceRef` — see
//! its header for why the YCbCr plane textures and the rotated targets share one mechanism there.
//!
//! The runtime models a rotated texture over a **buffer standing for** an IOSurface plane
//! (`Buffer::new_texture_with_iosurface_plane`), because a Metal-less host has no IOSurface. Metal
//! has no such stand-in: `framebufferOnly` over anything but an IOSurface plane makes it assert, so
//! the Metal leg of a rotated case needs an actual surface, which is why the two sides of this
//! family read the same [`PlaneSpec`] and build different things from it.
//!
//! # The private setters
//!
//! `MTLTextureDescriptor`'s `setRotation:` and `setFramebufferOnly:` are Apple SPI, reached by
//! selector and **only after `respondsToSelector:`** (`MetalSide::require_selector`), so a release
//! that stops answering them gives a typed refusal naming the selector rather than an
//! unrecognised-selector crash. Both were verified answered on an Apple M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1
//! (26A434), where the descriptor also reads the rotation back.
//!
//! # The stride rule, which is a safety rule
//!
//! **Metal asserts, ending the process, on an IOSurface texture whose `bytesPerRow` is below the
//! texture's `width` times its bytes per element** — not the *surface's* width, the texture's,
//! whatever the rotation. Measured here the hard way, by a probe that died:
//!
//! ```text
//! _mtlValidateStrideTextureParameters:1938: failed assertion `Texture Descriptor Validation
//! IOSurface texture: bytesPerRow (16) must be greater or equal to (32) bytes'
//! ```
//!
//! for a 4x8 surface at its own tight stride of 16 behind an 8x4 texture. So [`PlaneSpec::unsafe_stride`]
//! is checked before any descriptor reaches Metal, and a case whose plane would breach it is
//! refused rather than run. This is the suite's no-ending-the-process rule made mechanical for this
//! family.

/// Where a rotated framebuffer-only texture's texels live: the plane's extent, its stride, the
/// rotation the descriptor's private setter takes, and the byte the plane starts as.
