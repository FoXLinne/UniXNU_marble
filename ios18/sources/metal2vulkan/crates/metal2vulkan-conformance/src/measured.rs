//! The Metal measurements this tree already holds, as a ported case reads them.
//!
//! A probe's values live in two places: a runtime lane's literal table, which a ported case
//! restates, and, where a table was too large to write out, a committed text beside the lane's
//! fixtures (`fixtures/public/<lane>/`). Those texts are our own measurements over our own
//! fixtures, written by our own probes, and reaching them is what the boundary allows: the
//! harvested corpus, the stored observations and the censuses are a different thing and no case
//! touches them.
//!
//! A case reads such a file through [`public_fixture`], which resolves from
//! `metal2vulkan_devtools`, and pins its SHA-256 in its own input fingerprint. So the case says
//! which version of the measurement its recording stands on, and a file that changes makes the
//! case [`Unrecorded`](crate::verdict::Verdict::Unrecorded) rather than quietly comparing against
//! other bytes.
