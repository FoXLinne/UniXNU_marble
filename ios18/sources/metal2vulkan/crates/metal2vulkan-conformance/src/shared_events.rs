//! What a shared event's value does: the vocabulary for the event family's first case.
//!
//! `MTLSharedEvent`'s value **only rises**, from the host and from the GPU alike: a lower value set
//! or signalled leaves it where it was. A host wait for a value the event has reached answers at
//! once, and one for a value above it runs out.
//!
//! Every fact here is a value or a boolean, so the record is a small set of fields rather than
//! bytes, and the GPU's part is three command buffers that encode one signal each and nothing else.
