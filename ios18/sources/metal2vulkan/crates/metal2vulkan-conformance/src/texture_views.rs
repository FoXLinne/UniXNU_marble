//! A view of a texture, as both sides ask for one, and what the view answers about its parent:
//! `MTLTexture`'s four view creators, `parentTexture`, `parentRelativeLevel`,
//! `parentRelativeSlice`, `swizzle`, `shareable` and `newSharedTextureHandle`.
//!
//! [`crate::texture::Over::View`] already makes a view, but only ever of `0..levels` and
//! `0..slices` through one of the four selectors — so every view the suite had made began at its
//! parent's own first level and slice, and the two relative getters could only ever answer 0. This
//! type states the **ranges**, and states which of the four calls makes the view, which is what
//! lets a case ask the questions Metal actually settles:
//!
//! - what `parentRelativeLevel` of a view **of a view** counts from: the immediate parent, or the
//!   root of the chain. The runtime models the immediate parent, and nothing until now compared
//!   that against Metal;
//! - what `swizzle` a view made by a call that takes none answers — the parent's, or the default;
//! - whether the one-argument `newTextureViewWithPixelFormat:` and the
//!   `textureType:levels:slices:` form agree on the whole texture;
//! - whether `newTextureViewWithDescriptor:` answers exactly what the five-argument selector does
//!   for the same ranges, which is the only way the suite reaches `MTLTextureViewDescriptor` at
//!   all.
//!
//! # Why every case over this type is safe
//!
//! A view holds no memory: the call is Metal's own bookkeeping over a texture that already exists,
//! it compiles nothing, allocates no texels and reaches no queue. The textures the views are made
//! of are small and uncompressed, and nothing here dispatches or draws.
//!
//! The hazard a view creator carries is a range outside the parent's, or a format of another size
//! class, which Metal's validation stops — ending its process. So [`ViewRequest::is_well_formed`]
//! decides that from the request's own shape and the parent's, a case's guard reaches it with no
//! device at all, and the Metal side calls it before it makes the call.
