//! What a **render pipeline descriptor** answers of itself: `MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor`'s own
//! surface, and what `reset` puts back.
//!
//! [`crate::pipeline_facts`] is the pipeline **state**'s side of this: a state is immutable and
//! answers what its descriptor decided. This is the descriptor, before any state exists. The two
//! are different questions, and the second is where Metal's **defaults** live: a program that sets
//! six fields of thirty-four gets Metal's value for the other twenty-eight, and every one of them
//! reaches a pipeline we compile.
//!
//! The runtime has no descriptor object. Its
//! [`RenderPipelineDescriptor`](metal2vulkan::pipeline::RenderPipelineDescriptor) is a plain
//! struct a consumer fills, so its defaults are the ones
//! [`RenderPipelineDescriptor::new`](metal2vulkan::pipeline::RenderPipelineDescriptor::new) writes
//! and nothing in the tree ties any of them to a Metal run: the factor of 16, the pow-2
//! partitioning, the clockwise winding, the call-stack depth of 1, the unspecified topology, the
//! `One`/`Zero`/`Add` blend of an attachment nobody blended. They were read off Apple's
//! documentation. A case over this family is what holds them to Metal.
//!
//! `reset` is the same claim from the other end. Metal's descriptor is mutable and `reset` puts
//! every field back; the runtime's counterpart is `RenderPipelineDescriptor::new` again (the
//! coverage map says so), because a fresh struct **is** the reset. So a case that sets every field
//! away from its default, resets, and reads everything back says "the defaults a program gets after
//! a reset are the defaults it gets at the start", on both sides at once.
//!
//! # What the site observes, and what it cannot
//!
//! Four of Metal's getters answer **objects a program supplies**, and the runtime takes each one
//! somewhere other than the descriptor:
//!
//! - `binaryArchives` is `PipelineOptions.binary_archives`;
//! - `vertexPreloadedLibraries` and `fragmentPreloadedLibraries` are each stage's
//!   `FunctionDescriptor.libraries`;
//! - `vertexLinkedFunctions` and `fragmentLinkedFunctions` are each stage's
//!   `FunctionDescriptor.linked`.
//!
//! For those the site records **how many** of each the descriptor holds, never the objects. The
//! four per-stage ones are also the four sites [`Shape::Reset`] leaves out, for the measured reason
//! [`SuppliedLists`] states. Metal
//! answers nil for a list nothing set and the runtime answers an empty `LinkedFunctions` or
//! `DynamicLibraries`, which mean the same thing — nothing linked, nothing preloaded — and only one
//! of the two shapes can be a number both sides state. A count is that shape, and `nil` is counted
//! as none. **This family therefore compares those five items at their default alone**: it says the
//! lists start empty and that a reset empties them, and says nothing about a descriptor carrying a
//! real archive or dynamic library. That is a narrower case, not a loosened one — no value is
//! widened anywhere — and the wider case waits on cases for `MTLBinaryArchive` and
//! `MTLDynamicLibrary`, which no case of the suite reaches at all.
//!
//! `vertexDescriptor` is recorded **slot by slot** rather than as an object that is there or not,
//! for the same reason and on the same evidence: Metal's `init` leaves a non-nil, empty vertex
//! descriptor (measured here, at the oracle), the runtime's field is `None` until a program sets
//! one, and both mean no attribute is fetched.
//!
//! `shaderValidation` is deliberately absent: Apple's enumeration has no counterpart in the
//! runtime, and a getter whose answer nothing of ours can state is not a comparison.
//!
//! # Why every case of this family is safe
//!
//! Nothing here is compiled, allocated or submitted. A case makes one library, one or two
//! functions of it, and a descriptor it never hands to `newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor:`. No
//! command buffer is made, so no case can fault the device, trip its watchdog or reach a queue.
//!
//! The one hazard a descriptor's own surface carries is a **setter** Metal's validation stops, and
//! there is exactly one in this family's reach: `setLabel:` with nil ends Metal's process (the
//! compute and render pipeline sides both say so where they set it). No shape here sets a nil
//! label — the label is set only where the case states one — and the default shape reads the nil
//! Metal's own `init` left.
