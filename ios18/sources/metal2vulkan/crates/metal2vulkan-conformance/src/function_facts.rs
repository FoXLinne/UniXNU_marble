//! What a function says about **itself**: `MTLFunction`'s own getters, and the two objects they
//! answer with — `MTLVertexAttribute`, `MTLAttribute` and `MTLFunctionConstant`.
//!
//! [`crate::function_bindings`] compares what a function's reflection says its **arguments** are.
//! This is the other side of the same object: the kind of entry point it is, the patch it
//! evaluates, the stage-input attributes it declares, and the function constants it reads. Four
//! containers that the suite reached nowhere — `MTLFunction` at one item of twelve, and
//! `MTLAttribute`, `MTLVertexAttribute` and `MTLFunctionConstant` at none of theirs.
//!
//! Every field here is a number, an enumeration or a name, so the whole tree compares exactly and
//! nothing in it is the host's own. The one fact that is not portable is the `device` object
//! itself, and what the case asks of it is the one portable question the getter answers: did the
//! function come from the case's own device ([`FunctionFacts::device_is_the_cases`]), the shape
//! [`crate::argument_encoders::EncoderFacts`] already uses.
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! `vertexAttributes` and `stageInputAttributes` answer **declaration order**, which both sides
//! state, so an attribute's site is named by its position and the position is part of the answer.
//! `functionConstantsDictionary` answers a dictionary, which has no order at all, so a constant's
//! site is named by its own name — unique among a dictionary's keys by construction, which is what
//! keeps two sibling sites from sharing a name.
//!
//! # A specialized function
//!
//! A function made with constant values (`newFunctionWithName:constantValues:error:`) is the
//! function specialized: it leaves out an attribute its constants gate off, keeps the others, and
//! answers **no** function constants. That is the only way to reach `MTLFunctionConstantValues`,
//! whose three setters a case states as [`ConstantValue`]s.
