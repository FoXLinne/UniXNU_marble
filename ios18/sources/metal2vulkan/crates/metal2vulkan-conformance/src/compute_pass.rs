//! What a case asks an `MTLComputeCommandEncoder` to do: one pass, its commands stated in order.
//!
//! [`Side::dispatch`](crate::case::Side::dispatch) and
//! [`Side::dispatch_threads`](crate::case::Side::dispatch_threads) are a **fixed** compute pass:
//! the pipeline, the bindings at 0 up per kind, one dispatch, commit. Four of
//! `MTLComputeCommandEncoder`'s thirty-six items are reachable that way and the rest are not
//! reachable at all — not the inline bytes, not the plural setters, not the LOD-clamped sampler
//! bindings, not the dynamic threadgroup allocation, not the residency declarations, not the
//! barriers, not the threadgroup-grid dispatch and not the indirect one.
//!
//! So a case states the pass's commands the way [`crate::render::RenderStep`] states a render
//! pass's: a list, in order, each naming the Metal call it makes. Three things follow from the
//! shape rather than from care:
//!
//! - **Every command is encoded, whatever an earlier one answered**, as the render and mesh passes
//!   do, and the answer says which command refused ([`ComputePassOutcome::refused`], one entry per
//!   step). A refusal of ours then compares against Metal's answer at that step and reads as a
//!   refusal rather than as a shape mismatch.
//! - **One command buffer, one encoder, one commit.** Several dispatches of a case go in the same
//!   encoder, so a case that chains one dispatch's output into the next reads what *these*
//!   dispatches wrote. A committed command buffer between the halves would give each half its own
//!   run, and a second half that read the first run's leftovers would round-trip bit-exactly with
//!   the first half doing nothing at all.
//! - **Residency is the case's**, never the side's. A side here makes nothing resident on its own:
//!   a case that reaches a resource other than through a bound slot says
//!   [`ComputeStep::UseResource`] or [`ComputeStep::UseResources`], which is both what Metal
//!   requires and how those two items get exercised.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a device name, a vendor or an environment variable: a venue that refuses one
//! of these commands refuses it typed, at its own step.
