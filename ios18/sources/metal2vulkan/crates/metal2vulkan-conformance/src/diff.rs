//! What a divergence is and how it prints.
//!
//! A failure names the site that moved by its path from the root and says, in one line, **how
//! much** of it moved: how many of the site's leaves differ and the largest difference where the
//! values are numbers. Then it prints the first differing leaf ([`DivergenceKind::detail`]) for a
//! reader who wants somewhere to start. It never prints two whole values and leaves the reader to
//! bisect them.
//!
//! # Why the summary leads and the position follows
//!
//! That first line is what a `known-gaps.tsv` row's `answer` field holds, so it has to be both
//! honest and **stable**.
//!
//! Honest: a bound read off the first mismatch is not a bound. Of twelve rotated-target
//! divergences measured in this round, every one differs by a single code at the first mismatch
//! and four reach **two** codes well past it -- one of them at row 1, byte 905 -- so a row taken
//! from the first mismatch would have told a reader the gap was one code.
//!
//! Stable: a typed error is a property of the code path, but a first-mismatch position is a
//! property of the **data walk**, so changing any earlier leaf renames the row without the gap
//! changing at all. A count of differing leaves and the largest difference are properties of the
//! comparison, so they do not move for reasons unrelated to the bug.
//!
//! The shape is `site`, `count`, and then whatever that kind can say. It degrades cleanly: a
//! count exists for every kind, and only the largest difference is numbers-only, so a texel
//! divergence reads "8419 elements differ, the largest difference 2" and a missing field reads as
//! the one fact it is. Where a site has exactly one leaf the two values **are** the whole fact and
//! are printed, because they are stable too.
