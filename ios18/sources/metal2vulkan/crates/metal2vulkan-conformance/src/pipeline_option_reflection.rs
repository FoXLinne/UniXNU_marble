//! Every `MTLPipelineOption` value, and every combination of them, against what each one makes a
//! pipeline creation answer.
//!
//! `MTLPipelineOption` is three defined bits and a `None`:
//!
//! | bit | name | what it is claimed to do |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | — | `MTLPipelineOptionNone` | the creation answers no reflection |
//! | `1 << 0` | `MTLPipelineOptionBindingInfo` (and the deprecated `MTLPipelineOptionArgumentInfo`, the same bit) | the creation answers the pipeline's reflection |
//! | `1 << 1` | `MTLPipelineOptionBufferTypeInfo` | the same, with the buffers' types |
//! | `1 << 2` | `MTLPipelineOptionFailOnBinaryArchiveMiss` | a creation that lists a binary archive fails unless an archive holds its pipeline |
//!
//! Three bits are eight values, and [`MASKS`] is all eight: every single bit, every pair, the
//! triple, and `None`. The suite reached exactly **one** of them before this family —
//! `BindingInfo`, through [`crate::cases::function_bindings`] — so the claims the other seven
//! stand on were the runtime's own documentation and nothing else.
//!
//! # The two claims the sweep is pointed at
//!
//! - **`BufferTypeInfo` is the same as `BindingInfo`.** `metal2vulkan-runtime`'s own
//!   documentation says so outright: "`MTLPipelineOptionBufferTypeInfo`: the same as
//!   `BINDING_INFO` (Metal's reflection carries the buffers' types under either)". If that is
//!   wrong, the mask `1 << 1` alone is where it shows: Metal would answer a reflection with no
//!   buffer struct type, or no reflection at all, and we would answer the full one.
//! - **`FailOnBinaryArchiveMiss` does nothing without an archive.** The runtime's documentation
//!   says a creation "that lists at least one archive is refused unless the archives hold the
//!   archive key of each of its stages" and that "without archives, or without the option,
//!   archives only make creation faster". No case lists an archive here, so every mask with
//!   `1 << 2` in it must answer exactly what the same mask without it answers — and a creation
//!   that refused instead would be a refusal of something plain Metal does.
//!
//! # What is compared, and why it is the whole reflection
//!
//! Each case records whether the creation was refused, whether a reflection came, and — where one
//! came — **every binding of it**, in the shape [`crate::function_bindings`] already compares: the
//! name, the type, the access, the index, whether it is used, whether it is an argument, and the
//! buffer, texture or threadgroup facts each kind carries, the buffer's struct members among them.
//! A reflection compared only by its presence would say nothing about which option filled it in.
//!
//! # Why a value is seen to change the answer
//!
//! `MTLPipelineOptionNone` answers **no** reflection and every mask holding `1 << 0` or `1 << 1`
//! answers one, so the sweep's own rows disagree with each other at the reflection site. That is
//! what makes the family a measurement rather than eight identical passes: a side that ignored its
//! options and always reflected, or never did, fails at least one row of every sweep.
//!
//! # Why this family is safe
//!
//! Each case makes one library and compiles one kernel. Nothing is allocated for the device, no
//! command buffer is made, nothing is dispatched, and no undefined option bit is ever passed:
//! `MASKS` holds only the bits Apple's header names, so no case asks Metal to interpret a value it
//! has no meaning for.
