//! What a **library** says about itself, and the function a descriptor makes of it.
//!
//! [`crate::function_facts`] compares what one function answers of itself and
//! [`crate::function_bindings`] what its reflection says its arguments are. Both reach their
//! function through `newFunctionWithName:`, so the object that holds them — `MTLLibrary` — was
//! compared at two items of eleven: the two function-making calls. Its own four getters
//! (`device`, `functionNames`, `type`, `installName`) and `newFunctionWithDescriptor:error:` were
//! compared nowhere, and `MTLFunctionDescriptor` was a container no case touched at all.
//!
//! The getters are not decoration. `functionNames` is what a consumer enumerates a library by
//! before it knows any entry point's name; `type` is what separates an executable library from a
//! dynamic one, which refuses every `newFunctionWithName:`; and `installName` is the name a
//! dynamic library is resolved against. Our side answers the three from the metallib container's
//! own header and function list, so what this family holds to Metal is that reading of the
//! container.
//!
//! # `functionNames` is a set and a count, and the order is Metal's own
//!
//! Metal answers an `NSArray` and our side a `Vec`, but the site holds the names as a **set**
//! beside their **count**, because the order is not a fact either side states. Measured on the
//! oracle while recording: given the same metallib bytes, Metal answers the seven functions of
//! `px_samplers` in an order that is neither the container's function-list order, nor its reverse,
//! nor alphabetical, while our side answers the container's own order — the same order whether it
//! reads the metallib or the bare AIR bitcode. The repository's own reflection probe already reads
//! this getter `.sorted()` for that reason.
//!
//! What the set buys is that the comparison still bites: a missing name, an extra name, a name
//! spelled differently reads as exactly that in the diff, and the count beside it catches a side
//! that answered one name twice where a set would have collapsed the pair. What it gives up is
//! stated here rather than hidden: a side that answers the right names in another order passes
//! this family, and the order divergence above is an open item rather than a case.
//!
//! # A descriptor is three facts a function then carries
//!
//! `MTLFunctionDescriptor` has no getters a case can usefully read back off the descriptor: what
//! it is *for* is the function it makes. So its three settable facts are compared through that
//! function — `name` through [`crate::function_facts::FunctionFacts::name`], `constantValues` through the specialized
//! attribute lists and the empty constants dictionary, and `options` through
//! [`crate::function_facts::FunctionFacts::options`], which every case made by name answers `MTLFunctionOptionNone` for.
//! A descriptor whose options a side dropped reads as a different `options` field rather than as
//! nothing.
