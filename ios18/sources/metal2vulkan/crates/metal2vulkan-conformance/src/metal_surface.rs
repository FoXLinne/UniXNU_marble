//! The IOSurfaces the Metal side lays a plane texture over, on macOS only.
//!
//! A texture of a two-plane YCbCr format exists **only** over an IOSurface:
//! `newTextureWithDescriptor:` answers nil for every one of the 69 formats, and so does a buffer's
//! texture of them (`cases::ycbcr_textures::FormatDescriptors` is that fact, recorded). So the
//! Metal side cannot make one from a descriptor the way it makes every other texture, and until
//! this module existed it answered `Failure::unavailable` and whole families carried their Metal
//! answer from a probe instead of being recorded.
//!
//! What a case states is a **buffer standing for the surface**, with each plane's first byte and
//! `bytesPerRow` ([`crate::case::PlaneTexture`]): that is what lets the runtime side run the case
//! where there is no CoreVideo. This module makes a real IOSurface whose allocation is laid out
//! exactly as the case says the buffer is — same plane offsets, same row pitches, same length —
//! and copies the buffer's bytes into it from byte 0. The two sides then read the same bytes
//! through the same layout, which is what makes their answers comparable at all.
//!
//! # The layout is asked for, and then checked
//!
//! `IOSurfaceCreate` is free to lay a surface out its own way: it reads the plane dictionary as a
//! request. So [`Surface::two_plane`] states the layout and [`Surface::planes_are_as_asked`] reads
//! it back plane by plane, and a surface that came out laid differently is a typed failure rather
//! than a comparison against bytes in other places. Nothing here silently repitches: a case's
//! recording says where the planes are, and if Apple's allocator disagrees, the case must be told
//! so rather than quietly answered.
//!
//! # The geometry comes from the format, not from a name table
//!
//! A plane's element size and its size in texels follow from the format's own layout —
//! `ycbcr_format`'s bits and chroma subsampling ([`planes_of`]) — not from the surface's
//! four-character OSType. `core_video_planes` is the guard on that derivation, used by the tests
//! alone: CoreVideo lays out a buffer of the same OSType and size, and the derivation must agree
//! with Apple's own answer plane for plane.
//!
//! # Two families, one surface
//!
//! A **rotated framebuffer-only target** needs a surface for the same reason: Metal makes such a
//! texture over an IOSurface alone, and asserts on `framebufferOnly` over anything else. So it
//! shares this module rather than declaring a second `IOSurfaceRef`, a second opaque type with a
//! second Objective-C encoding, and a second owner — which is what it had before the two were
//! merged. [`Surface::single_plane`] is its constructor and [`Surface::is_as_asked`] its read-back,
//! beside the two-plane pair, and `crate::metal_side` holds one pool of [`Surface`] for both.
//!
//! The two differ only in the layout they ask for and where that layout comes from: a plane
//! texture's is derived from the format's bit depth and subsampling ([`planes_of`]), and a rotated
//! target's is the case's own plane extent and stride, which must clear a rule of Metal's that
//! **ends the process** when it is broken (`crate::surface::PlaneSpec::unsafe_stride`).
//!
//! The frameworks are reached through their C functions (CoreFoundation and IOSurface), as
//! `metal2vulkan-validation`'s own surface probe reaches them and nothing else in this crate does,
//! which is why this is a module of its own; each object made here is released here.
