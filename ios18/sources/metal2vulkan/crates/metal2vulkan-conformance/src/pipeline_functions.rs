//! `MTLRenderPipelineFunctionsDescriptor`: the three per-stage lists of functions a program hands
//! `newRenderPipelineStateWithAdditionalBinaryFunctions:error:`, and what the descriptor answers
//! for each after a program has written them.
//!
//! The class was reached at none of its four items. What a case can say about it is a **round
//! trip**: three properties, written in a stated order and read straight back. That is a small
//! claim and the family [`crate::cases::pipeline_functions`] states it as one — but it is the only
//! claim the class has, because the one call that consumes the descriptor needs a binary archive
//! (the reason [`crate::pipeline_facts`] gives for leaving every binary-function item out), and
//! nothing else observes it.
//!
//! # What is compared, and what cannot be
//!
//! **Lengths and names, with Metal's nil folded to a length of zero.** Metal's getters answer nil
//! for a property no program wrote, and an empty array for one written with one; the runtime has
//! no descriptor **object** at all — a program hands it a
//! [`RenderPipelineFunctionsDescriptor`](metal2vulkan_runtime::RenderPipelineFunctionsDescriptor)
//! whose three fields are `Vec`s — so nil and empty are one answer on our side and there is
//! nothing there to observe the difference with. That is the same fold, for the same reason,
//! that [`crate::compute_descriptors::SuppliedLists`] applies to `preloadedLibraries` and
//! `linkedFunctions`, and it is stated here rather than widened quietly: a case that compared
//! nil against empty would be comparing a shape one side cannot hold.
//!
//! **A name, not a count.** The list holds the functions' `name`s in order, so a side that
//! dropped one, reordered two, or wrote a stage's list into another stage's property reads a
//! different list rather than the same length. A count alone would pass all three of those.
//!
//! **Our side's answer is a round trip through its own `Vec`.** The family therefore pins Metal's
//! behaviour and our type's contract; it does not exercise a computation of ours, and says so
//! rather than reading as more than it is.
