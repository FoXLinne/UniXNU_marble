//! A command queue's limit on uncompleted command buffers, as a probe both sides run.
//!
//! Metal's `commandBuffer` **blocks** once a queue holds `maxCommandBufferCount` uncompleted
//! command buffers, and answers once one of them completes or is dropped uncommitted. It never
//! answers nil. That is a behaviour nothing in the suite could state before: the fact under test is
//! that a call *did not return*, and then that it did once a slot came back.
//!
//! `runtime_lane::command_queues` holds the number — `METAL_DEFAULT: usize = 64` — as a constant
//! with the word "measured" beside it. A case over this probe measures it instead, on the oracle,
//! and records it keyed to the oracle.
//!
//! # Why no wait here can hang
//!
//! Every make runs on a thread of its own, and the command buffers it makes go into a shared list
//! the probe's own thread can drain. So a make that blocks is always released by the probe dropping
//! one held command buffer, and the worker is told to stop as soon as the probe has its answer: the
//! worker makes at most one command buffer after the probe is done with it, and is joined. Nothing
//! is committed, so nothing reaches the GPU and no wait is for the device.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! `maxCommandBufferCount:` of **0**. Metal's own validation ends the process on it (the runtime
//! answers `Invalid`, which is its word for exactly that), so no case may ask Metal for it. The
//! runtime's typed refusal of a count of 0 stays a `runtime_lane` assertion.
