//! What a **compute pipeline descriptor** answers of itself: `MTLComputePipelineDescriptor`'s own
//! surface, and what `reset` puts back.
//!
//! [`crate::render_descriptors`] is the same question of `MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor`, and the two
//! are built the same way for the same reason: a descriptor is where Metal's **defaults** live, and
//! a program that sets two fields of sixteen gets Metal's value for the other fourteen. This
//! family shares that module's [`Shape`] rather than declaring a second one.
//!
//! [`crate::pipeline_facts`] is the pipeline **state**'s side: what the made object echoes back.
//! Five of the descriptor's items were reached that way — `label`, `computeFunction`,
//! `stageInputDescriptor`, `supportIndirectCommandBuffers` and `requiredThreadsPerThreadgroup` —
//! and the rest of the surface was reached by nothing at all.
//!
//! The runtime has no descriptor object. Its
//! [`ComputePipelineDescriptor`](metal2vulkan::pipeline::ComputePipelineDescriptor) is a plain
//! struct a consumer fills, so its defaults are the ones
//! [`ComputePipelineDescriptor::new`](metal2vulkan::pipeline::ComputePipelineDescriptor::new)
//! writes: the call-stack depth of 1, the absent thread limit, the absent required threadgroup
//! size, the empty buffer-mutability map, the three flags off. Those were read off Apple's
//! documentation and nothing in the tree ran Metal to check one. `reset` is the same claim from
//! the other end: Metal's descriptor is mutable and `reset` puts every field back, while the
//! runtime's counterpart is `ComputePipelineDescriptor::new` again (the coverage map says so),
//! because a fresh struct **is** the reset.
//!
//! # What the site observes, and what it cannot
//!
//! **`stageInputDescriptor` is deliberately not here.** It is the one item of the surface already
//! compared against Metal (`indirect_commands` and `stage_in_regions` both state one), and no shape
//! of this family sets one, so a site for it could only ever hold the same `None` on both sides of
//! every case — a field that cannot differ, which is noise in a transcript rather than a
//! measurement. The whole of what a stated stage-input descriptor means belongs to
//! `MTLStageInputOutputDescriptor`'s own family.
//!
//! Four getters answer **objects a program supplies**, and the runtime takes each one somewhere
//! other than the descriptor:
//!
//! - `binaryArchives` is `PipelineOptions.binary_archives`;
//! - `preloadedLibraries` and its deprecated spelling `insertLibraries` are the kernel stage's
//!   `FunctionDescriptor.libraries`;
//! - `linkedFunctions` is the kernel stage's `FunctionDescriptor.linked`.
//!
//! For those the site records **how many** of each the list holds, never the objects, and a nil
//! list is none — the shape [`crate::render_descriptors`] gives its reasoning for. **This family
//! therefore compares those four items at their default alone**: it says the lists start empty and
//! that a reset empties them, and says nothing about a descriptor carrying a real archive or
//! dynamic library. That is a narrower case, not a loosened one; the wider case waits on cases for
//! `MTLBinaryArchive` and `MTLDynamicLibrary`, which no case of the suite reaches.
//!
//! `preloadedLibraries` and `insertLibraries` are read **both**, off a descriptor that set neither:
//! that the two are one property is a claim the runtime makes by holding a single
//! `FunctionDescriptor.libraries`, and reading both getters is what checks it, exactly as
//! [`crate::render_descriptors`] reads Metal's deprecated `sampleCount` beside `rasterSampleCount`.
//!
//! [`Shape::Reset`] leaves the three per-stage lists out, for the measured reason
//! [`SuppliedLists`] states.
//!
//! `shaderValidation` is absent: Apple's enumeration has no counterpart in the runtime, and a
//! getter whose answer nothing of ours can state is not a comparison.
//!
//! # Why every case of this family is safe
//!
//! Nothing here is compiled, allocated or submitted. A case makes one library, one function of it,
//! and a descriptor it never hands to `newComputePipelineStateWithDescriptor:`. No command buffer
//! is made, so no case can fault the device, trip its watchdog or reach a queue.
//!
//! The one hazard a descriptor's own surface carries is a **setter** Metal's validation stops, and
//! there is exactly one in reach: `setLabel:` with nil ends Metal's process (measured on this
//! family's oracle while recording [`crate::pipeline_facts`]). No shape here sets a nil label — the
//! label is set only where the shape states one — and the default shape reads the nil Metal's own
//! `init` left.
