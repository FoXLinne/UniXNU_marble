//! A device derives its profile's fingerprint **once**, and every compile on it takes that one
//! ([`DeviceProfile::fingerprint`](crate::device::DeviceProfile::fingerprint)).
//!
//! # What this guards
//!
//! The fingerprint is a SHA-256 over the derived `Debug` rendering of every field of the profile.
//! A profile with a format table renders tens of kilobytes, so one derivation is 46 to 64 us over
//! the committed profiles on an M3 Max -- not a rounding error inside a translation that costs one
//! to seven milliseconds.
//!
//! `Device::profile_fingerprint` has held a memo of it since the device was first built, but the
//! two call sites that mattered could not reach it: a stage's compile takes the fingerprint for
//! the compiled function's key (`pipeline::compile`'s `compile_one`, through `key::function_key`)
//! and again to stamp the artifact with the profile it was compiled for, and both hold a
//! `&DeviceProfile` rather than the device. So every translation re-rendered the whole profile
//! twice, and nothing counted it: the SPIR-V, the keys and the artifacts all came out identical,
//! so no golden table, no artifact check and no existing count could see the work.
//!
//! The derivation now happens where the profile is built (`DeviceProfile::of`), which is the only
//! place a profile comes from, and `fingerprint()` is a read.
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! The number of renderings a run costs is a fact of where the derivation sits, not of the host:
//! it holds under any load and needs no quiet machine. It is held in **both** directions. Over
//! the count is a caller that derives again; under it is a device that derives none, which would
//! mean the fingerprint came from somewhere other than its fields -- so the device's own making
//! is required to derive exactly one, which is what keeps the compiles' zero from being a
//! vacuous zero.
//!
//! The second test is the half a count catches on the low side and the one that matters for
//! correctness: a memo on a value that is supposed to vary must still vary. Two profiles that
//! differ must carry different fingerprints, and a profile edited through
//! `DeviceProfile::edit` must carry the edited fields' fingerprint and not the original's.
//! A stale fingerprint would make two different devices share cache entries, which is wrong and
//! not merely slow.
