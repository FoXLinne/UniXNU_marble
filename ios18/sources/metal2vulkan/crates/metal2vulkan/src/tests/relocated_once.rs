//! A run of sibling pipeline creations over one compiled function **relocates its module once**,
//! not once each (`pipeline::relocate::relocated`).
//!
//! # What this guards
//!
//! Relocation writes only the literals the serializer reserved, so a stage's final words are a
//! pure function of its module and the value link assigned to each reserved slot. A sweep of
//! pipeline states over one function pair -- a blend sweep, where no state reaches a reserved
//! slot -- therefore wants the same words on every creation, and measured on an M3 Max every
//! creation built them again: a fresh `Arc<[u32]>` of identical words per creation, which
//! everything keyed on a module's content then hashed and encoded afresh. The clone is one pass
//! over the words and the hashes are more, so the cost of a creation rose with the size of a
//! module nothing about the creation changed.
//!
//! The words now come from the function's relocation slot, which the first creation filled.
//!
//! # Why this is a count
//!
//! How many times a run relocates is a fact of where the words come from, not of the host: it
//! holds under any load and needs no quiet machine. It is held in **both** directions. Over the
//! count is a creation that relocates again; under it is a run that relocates nothing at all,
//! which would mean the words came from somewhere other than the module -- so the first creation
//! is required to relocate exactly once a stage, which is what keeps the siblings' zero from
//! being a vacuous zero.
//!
//! [`a_differing_link_gets_its_own_words`] is the half a count catches on the low side, and the
//! one that matters for correctness rather than speed: a memo on a value that is supposed to vary
//! must still vary. Two links that assign a module's slots different values must get different
//! words, and the slot must never answer one link with another's. It also asserts what makes the
//! fast path sound at all -- that the words the slot gives are byte-identical to relocating
//! again -- so the invariant `relocate.rs` states is checked rather than trusted.
