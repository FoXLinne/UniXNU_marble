//! The device's alpha to coverage, as render pipelines of the owned fixture `engine/a8r_targets`
//! (`a8r_vertex` and `a8r_fill`, a `float4` output to an `RGBA16Float` attachment 0) at one and
//! four samples, alpha to coverage off and on, on committed profiles.
//!
//! Vulkan specifies no algorithm for converting the alpha to a coverage mask, where Metal's
//! coverage is its own (a 2x2 ordered dither at two and four samples, measured on an Apple M3 Max
//! by `runtime_lane::alpha_coverage`), so a pipeline that covers by alpha
//! (`GraphicsState::alpha_to_coverage`) records `PrecisionNote::DeviceAlphaCoverage` on its
//! fragment stage, and the vertex stage records none; on a profile measured to cover as Metal
//! does (`DriverDeviation::MetalAlphaCoverage`: `moltenvk-m3`, MoltenVK on the M3 Max's macOS 27
//! identity) it records no note and requires `VkProperty::MetalAlphaCoverage` in its place. A
//! pipeline without alpha to coverage records neither, and requires no such property.
