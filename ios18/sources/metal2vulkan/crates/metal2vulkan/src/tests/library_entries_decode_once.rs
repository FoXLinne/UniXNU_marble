//! What the entries of **one** library cost to compile, counted rather than timed.
//!
//! # Why counts and not times
//!
//! Decoding a module reads its bitcode and nothing else: which entry of it is being compiled, and
//! with which constants, linked functions and call-stack depth, reaches no part of the decode. So
//! a library of six entries ought to decode its module once and not six times, and whether it
//! does is a count the build settles exactly, where a wall clock on a shared host settles
//! nothing. [`StageEntries::decodes`] counts the decodes read of bitcode and the asks that copied
//! one already read, and [`Meter::work`] counts deterministic work units -- the same input on the
//! same profile spends the same, whatever the load. Both are read here; no wall clock is.
//!
//! # What they hold
//!
//! - **One library, one decode.** Six entries of one module compiled through one
//!   [`StageEntries`], as the runtime's device gives one object to every creation of its
//!   pipelines, read **one** decode between them
//!   ([`the_entries_of_one_library_decode_its_module_once`]). An object each, which is what a
//!   consumer that shares nothing does, reads six.
//! - **A plain answer and the entry share it too.** A render creation asks whether its vertex
//!   stage returns a value before it compiles it, and both the question and the compile need the
//!   module's decode: through one object they read it once
//!   ([`a_plain_answer_and_the_stages_entry_decode_the_module_once`]).
//! - **Not across libraries.** Two libraries of different bytes read a decode each, however the
//!   object is shared: the module's own AIR hash keys the decode, so nothing of one library is
//!   taken for another ([`two_libraries_decode_their_modules_apart`]).
//! - **The same module, word for word.** Every entry compiled from a shared decode is the module
//!   its own unshared compile makes, word for word, and its artifact is byte for byte the same.
//! - **The hash is the library's, not a second one.** A compile records its function's AIR hash
//!   from the library's table rather than hashing the bitcode again, which is exact because a
//!   module's hash is the hash of the bytes every entry of it shares, and a metallib function's
//!   `HASH` is verified against its bitcode when the container is parsed
//!   ([`a_librarys_stated_air_hash_is_the_hash_of_the_bitcode_a_compile_reads`],
//!   [`a_metallib_whose_stated_hash_is_not_its_bitcodes_is_refused`]).
//! - **What holding it costs.** The headline part reports what one decode charges the ledger and
//!   holds four of the largest committed module's to the object's byte bound, so a bound that
//!   could not hold a library's one decode would fail here.
