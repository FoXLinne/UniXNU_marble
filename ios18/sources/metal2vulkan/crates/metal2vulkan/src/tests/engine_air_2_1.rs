//! AIR 2.1's metadata records and texture declarations translate as today's.
//!
//! Apple's AIR 2.1 emitter writes three constructs in a shape its AIR 2.2 and later emitters do
//! not, each of which the front end once refused. The owned fixture `air_2_1_front_end` carries
//! all three: its deployment target (macOS 10.14) is what selects the AIR version, so the module
//! records `air64_v21` and `!air.version = !{i32 2, i32 1, i32 0}`.
//!
//! - The function-constant initializer global sits in no section, where AIR 2.2 and later place it
//!   in `air.fc_initializer` (`abi::check`). A module whose `air.function_constants` record is
//!   refused has no ABI at all.
//! - A vertex output restates its member's interpolation qualifier on `air.vertex_output`, and
//!   restates it partly: `uv`'s `[[centroid_perspective]]` writes `air.centroid` with no
//!   `air.perspective` (`abi::args`). A refused key there also costs the module its ABI.
//! - A sample, gather, or read states no residency status: its result is the texel alone rather
//!   than `{T, i8}`, and a sample carries no min-LOD-clamp operand
//!   (`intrinsics::Texture::status`). A read is also in the operand form without the sampler and
//!   offset positions, which AIR 2.8 added. An unmatched declaration is
//!   `Intrinsic(SignatureMismatch)`, so the module does not read.
//!
//! So every entry compiling on every committed profile is what holds the first two: without them
//! the fixture has no ABI and names no entry. The third is held by the entries that sample, gather
//! and read.
//!
//! Where the declaration states no status, the call's own result is the texel, so
//! `lower::texture::alpha` follows the lanes from the call rather than through an
//! `extractvalue 0`. `a21_blit_fs` takes lane 0 of its read and `a21_alpha_fs` the whole texel, so
//! on a profile whose reads the shader checks the first needs no `OutOfBoundsAlpha`
//! specialization and the second does; reading the result as the whole `{T, i8}` struct would ask
//! for it on both.
//!
//! `llvm-as` assembles the fixture; without it the tests skip visibly.
