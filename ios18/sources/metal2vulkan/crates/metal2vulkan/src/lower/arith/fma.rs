//! Fused multiply-add on `float` and `half`.
//!
//! Metal's `fma` (`air.fma`, `llvm.fma`) rounds the exact `a * b + c` once. Vulkan's
//! `GLSL.std.450 Fma` does not promise that (its precision is inherited from an `OpFMul`
//! followed by an `OpFAdd`), so a `float` fused multiply-add takes one of two routes, by what
//! the profile offers ([`float_route`]):
//!
//! - [`Route::Khr`]: `OpFmaKHR` (`SPV_KHR_fma`, `shaderFmaFloat32` of `VK_KHR_shader_fma`),
//!   which the Vulkan precision table lists as correctly rounded, at the device's denormals and
//!   NaN encoding (on MoltenVK Metal's own `fma`);
//! - [`Route::Native`]: the device's `GLSL.std.450 Fma`, within Vulkan's precision rather than
//!   rounded once (`PrecisionNote::NativeFma`).
//!
//! Where the driver is measured to compute `GLSL.std.450 Fma` on 16-bit floats as Metal's own
//! `half` `fma` (`DriverDeviation::MetalHalfFma`: MoltenVK on Apple's GPUs) and the profile has
//! `shaderFloat16`, a `half` one takes [`Route::F16`]: its operands, each a `half` held in a
//! `float`, convert to 16 bits exactly, the device's `Fma` rounds the exact sum once as Metal
//! does, and its result widens exactly; the module then requires `VkProperty::MetalHalfFma`.
//!
//! Where the profile has `shaderFmaFloat16` and rounds to `half` under the 16-bit float controls
//! ([`QuantizeForm::Controlled`], [`narrow::controlled_modes`]), a `half` one takes
//! [`Route::F16Khr`]: its operands convert to 16 bits exactly, `OpFmaKHR` on them rounds the exact
//! sum once, and its result widens exactly. Vulkan's precision table lists `OpFmaKHR` as "Correctly
//! rounded", "according to IEEE 754 roundTiesToEven" under `RoundingModeRTE`, with denormals kept
//! under `DenormPreserve` and zero signs under `SignedZeroInfNanPreserve`, which the entry then
//! declares (`narrow::computes_in_16_bits`): Metal's `half` `fma`, with no fact. A NaN's bits are
//! the device's, as the controlled rounding's are. Every other `half` one takes [`Route::Native`]: the device's `float` `Fma`
//! of the operands held in `float`, whose product is exact there, rounded to `half`.
//!
//! An extended-range blend computes its own correctly rounded multiply-adds ([`half_sum`],
//! [`float_fma_exact`]): the blend the device cannot do, in plain arithmetic.
