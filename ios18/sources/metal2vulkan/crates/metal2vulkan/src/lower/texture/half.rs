//! The conversion of a texel to a `half` result on a device that samples through Metal's own
//! texture unit (`VkProperty::MetalSampler`: MoltenVK on Apple's GPU).
//!
//! A read, gather, or sample with a `half` result takes the device's `f32` texel (Metal's `float`
//! result of the same access there, filtered where the access filters) rounded to `half` to
//! nearest even by the module's rounding (`narrow::round_texel`), on every device: the device's
//! native conversion. Metal's own `half` result differs from it for a few classes, which the
//! module notes (`PrecisionNote::HalfTexelConversion`, `texture::half_texels`): a 32-bit float
//! texel's sample (Metal rounds toward zero, saturating at `±65504`), the 16-bit normalized grids
//! (Metal's `float` value of `65455 / 65535`, `65519 / 65535` and `32759 / 32767` rounds twice),
//! and a format whose conversion is not measured. Every other class's `float` result rounds to
//! Metal's `half` (`metal_float_steps_round_to_their_half`).
//!
//! **The routine** ([`define`]): `fn(x: vec4, flags: u32, channel: u32) -> vec4`, called with the
//! slot's `SpecKey::TexelFormat` class (`metal::texel_format`), keeps one more of Metal's rules: a
//! two-plane YCbCr format's one texel on the grid `8192` (`TexelFormat::YCBCR_8192`: a read or a
//! sample of one texel, `TexelLanes::Texel`, and a 2D gather's lanes, `Gathered`) rounds its step
//! with ties away from zero (`texel_round::f32_to_half_from_even`), as Metal's does (every channel
//! of five formats on the grid `8192`, and the gathers; measured on an Apple M3 Max, macOS 26.7).
//! Every other texel, a value that may be filtered among them (`TexelLanes::Filtered`), rounds to
//! nearest even.
//!
//! **The plain arm.** A slot's access whose texel an image instruction hands back
//! ([`TexelOrigin::Image`]) converts it under the slot's `SpecKey::PlainHalfTexels`
//! specialization, which states that the bound class has no such YCbCr field
//! (`TexelFormat::plain_on_metal_sampler`): there by the device's conversion of the texel itself
//! (`narrow::round_texel`, which Metal's compiler may fold into the image instruction), else by
//! the routine, so specialization leaves one of them. The class stays push data, so only a slot
//! that sees both kinds of class makes a second pipeline. A computed texel keeps the routine.
//!
//! Elsewhere the device's own sampler hands back its `float` texel, and the `half` is that texel
//! rounded to nearest even, no routine (`texture::device_texels`).
