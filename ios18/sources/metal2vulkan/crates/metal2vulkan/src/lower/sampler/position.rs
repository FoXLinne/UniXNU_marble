//! Metal's texel-space position of a normalized coordinate, which the filters the device has no
//! form for read their footprints from (`bicubic`, `extended`, `heap_raw`, `in_place`, and the
//! residency `footprint`), and Metal's placement of a texel offset on a repeating or mirrored axis.
//!
//! **The position** (Apple M3 Max, macOS 26.7, and Apple M4, macOS 27.0.1, byte-identical; the
//! tie, gather, and bicubic probes). Per axis of size `N` and normalized coordinate `u`, Apple's
//! texture unit first wraps `u` into one period, in `f32`, where the axis repeats: `u' = u -
//! floor(u)` under `repeat`, `u' = u - 2 floor(u / 2)` under `mirrored_repeat` (a period of two),
//! the subtraction rounded toward positive infinity (`wrap`; it rounds at all only where `-1 < u <
//! 0`), or exactly where `N` is a power of two (below). Then it scales: `X = u' N` rounded to `f32`
//! with ties away from zero. A clamping axis scales `u` itself. Every filter reads its footprint
//! from `X`: the linear and bicubic filters and a gather the quantized `q = floor(256 X + 1/2) -
//! 128`, a nearest filter `floor(X)`, and the taps then wrap modulo `N` or mirror with period `2N`.
//! The probes measured the wrap on the linear, nearest, gather, and bicubic filters (every lane,
//! both chips), and the ties on the linear, gather, and bicubic filters under `clamp_to_zero`,
//! where a product exactly half a unit in the last place from two `f32`s decides the footprint. The
//! wrap's rounding comes from the position cases (`wrg_sampler_positions` at 13x11, 7x5, and 255x3
//! on the M3, whose outputs the M4's equal byte for byte): rounded up, every linear, nearest,
//! gather, and bicubic result of their repeating and mirrored axes is Metal's; rounded to nearest
//! even, with ties away, or not at all, it misses lanes with `-1 < u < 0` whose wrapped `u'` needs
//! more bits than an `f32` holds.
//!
//! **A power-of-two size wraps exactly**. On a repeating or mirrored axis whose size is a power of
//! two, Metal reads the footprints of the exact `u'`, per axis: the linear-filter probes (M4 and
//! M3, byte-identical) at 2D 16x8 and 4x32 and 3D 16x16x16, 8x4x2 and 16x8x4, and on the 4-texel
//! axis of a 9x4x11 texture whose other axes round up, and the position cases at 16x8, 4x32 and
//! 16x11 (linear, nearest, and gathers, `gather_compare` included; M3 and M4). `wrap` rounds the
//! subtraction down there, which reads the same footprints: `u' N` is then exact, and every step a
//! footprint reads (an integer, or `i + 1/2` plus a multiple of `1/512`) lies on the `1/512` grid,
//! which an `f32` holds exactly below `2^15`, so rounding `u'` down never carries `X` across one.
//! Rounded up, it reads one `1/256` step, sometimes a texel, high where `-1 < u < 0` lands just
//! below a step.
//!
//! Multiplying first and wrapping the taps after (as a Vulkan device does) reads another footprint wherever `u` lies outside `[0, 1)` on a size that is not a
//! power of two and `u N` lands near a step: the product rounds at the magnitude of `u N`, not of
//! `u' N`. At a power-of-two size `u N` is exact, and multiplying first reads Metal's footprints.
//!
//! **Ties away from zero, in integers** ([`position`]). `p = u' N` rounded to nearest even is a tie
//! rounded toward zero exactly when the bits of the exact product below `p`'s last place are
//! `100…0` and `p`'s significand is even; then `X` is the next `f32` away from zero, `p`'s bits
//! plus one. The exact product's low bits are those of `bits(u') * N` (an `OpIMul`, modulo `2^32`):
//! `u'`'s exponent and implicit bit sit at bit 23 and up, so they never reach the bits the test
//! reads. Those are bits `0` to `s`, where `s` is `p`'s biased exponent less `u'`'s (the sign bits
//! cancel, `p` having `u'`'s sign); a shift left by `31 - s` puts them at the top of the word,
//! where the tie reads `0x4000_0000`. This is exact for every finite normal `u'` and every
//! `N < 2^22`, where `s <= 22` and the bits stay below bit 23; Metal's sizes are at most `2^14`. A
//! denormal `u'` may be adjusted wrongly, by one unit in the last place of an `X` below `2^-100`,
//! which moves no footprint. A tie moves a footprint only at a negative position, or at one of
//! `2^14` or more. Where the two neighbours of a tie lie on either side of a footprint's step (an
//! integer, or a gather's `i + 1/2 - 1/512`), the upper neighbour is the step, whose significand is
//! even below `2^14`: the even rounding picks it, as ties away from zero does for a positive
//! position, while at a negative one ties away from zero picks the lower. That is why the probes'
//! deciding lanes were clamped axes' negative coordinates, and a repeating or mirrored axis, whose
//! position is never negative, differs only at sizes of at least `2^13` (mirrored) or `2^14`
//! (repeating). A product past `f32`'s range gives an unspecified `X`, as before (the footprints
//! read no non-finite position: `bicubic`). The test is 12 integer instructions on every device;
//! `OpFmaKHR` for the product's error would take 11, and only where `shaderFmaFloat32` is enabled.
//!
//! **A texel offset on a repeating or mirrored axis** ([`offset_dropped`]). Metal adds a constant
//! texel offset to the tap and then wraps it, as Vulkan places it, but on a repeating or mirrored
//! axis whose level size `n` lies in `[2, 7]` and whose texture's base-level size on that axis is
//! not a power of two: there it drops the offset on that axis. At the base level that is a size of
//! 3, 5, 6, or 7. The offset probes:
//! - round 1, Apple M4 on macOS 27.0.1 and Apple M3 Max on macOS 26.7, byte-identical, each run
//!   with and without Metal's validation layer: every 2D size from 1 to 17 per axis and eight
//!   larger controls, offsets -8 to 7 per axis, nearest and linear samples, gathers of each
//!   component, and a depth texture's gathers; a clamping axis places the offset as Vulkan does
//!   on every size;
//! - round 2, the M4: base levels up to 16384, 2D arrays and 3D textures, per axis;
//! - round 3, the M4: every level of 18 bases at an explicit level, nearest and linear samples
//!   (level sizes 2 and 4 drop it under a base that is not a power of two and keep it under one
//!   that is; sizes 3, 5 and 6 drop it, and 8 and above keep it, under either), and each level
//!   above the base through a view of that one level, which reads exactly as the level does: the
//!   view's parent's base-level size decides.
//!
//! An emulated footprint applies the rule to its taps (`bicubic::axis`). The base-level size the
//! rule reads is a view's parent's, which a shader
//! cannot query: a view whose first level lies above its parent's base reads the bound view's
//! own, so on an axis of size 2 or 4 under a parent base that is not a power of two (where the
//! view's base is) the rule would keep the offset Metal drops. The binder states those axes in the
//! slot's `SpecKey::OffsetBaseAxes` specialization (0 for every texture that is not such a view),
//! whose tests (`texture::OffsetBase`) the rule reads; a heap element's access reads none, and
//! records `PrecisionNote::ViewBaseTexelOffset` (the residue there).
//!
//! **A runtime sampler's position** ([`position_by_mode`]): an emulation of a runtime or argument
//! buffer's sampler reads the address mode from the sampler's word in the function. On a
//! `MirrorClampToEdge` axis (which no constexpr sampler states) Metal's position is a clamping
//! axis's, `u N` unwrapped, its taps mirrored once and clamped as Vulkan's `MIRROR_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`
//! mirrors and clamps them, and a texel offset is dropped by the sizes that drop it on a repeating
//! axis (every gather of 13x11, 7x5 and 16x8 textures through a slot's and an argument buffer's
//! runtime sampler, with offsets of 2 and -3, on an Apple M3 Max and an Apple M4 alike), a pixel
//! coordinate's as a normalized one's.
