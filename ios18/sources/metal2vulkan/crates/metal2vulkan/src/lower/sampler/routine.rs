//! The sampling routines: the emulation a combined binding's sample shape takes, defined once in
//! the module and called by every sample of that shape with its plain data.
//!
//! **Why.** An emulation written at every sample site is compiled again at every site: the
//! consumer's CoreAnimation fragment `Xgc`, a linear filter emulated at each of its 256 sample
//! sites, was 246,000 instructions from 15,800 AIR instructions, about 574 instructions a sample
//! site; NVIDIA's driver compiled every copy, 13 to 26 s a pipeline on the RTX 5080. The same
//! emulation as one routine that 256 sites call, declared `DontInline`, made in 0.39 s on the RTX
//! 3090 where the 256 inlined copies took 10.2 s.
//!
//! **What a routine holds.** One per shape ([`Shape`]):
//! - [`Filter`]: Metal's anisotropic filter emulated (`anisotropic`): the level-0 size and level
//!   count, the sampler's degree and mip filter, the footprint, and the taps' samples at explicit
//!   levels and their sum.
//! - [`Extended`]: an extended-range texture's sample (`extended`): the levels its mip filter
//!   reads, the filter's footprint and addressing, the fetches and their decodes, the sums' calls,
//!   the border and the swizzle.
//!
//! The routine reads its binding's image and sampler variables and its slots' specialization
//! constants (the runtime sampler's word, the offset tests) itself, so no image handle crosses a
//! call, and a device's specialization folds its arithmetic as it folded each site's. The site
//! keeps the word's tests, the device's sample with its level, bias or gradients, and the texel's
//! conversion: no implicit level crosses a call, so every answer is the one the inline code gave.
//!
//! An anisotropic sample's call passes its coordinate (a cube's direction, its ties broken), its
//! gradients (a cube's on its face) and a cube's face steps, the array layer and the
//! `min_lod_clamp`, and its texel offset, constant or dynamic, where the profile admits the
//! `Offset` operand on a sample (`maintenance8` and `shaderImageGatherExtended`), which the taps'
//! samples take, so the samples at every offset call one routine; elsewhere a constant offset is
//! the shape's, as the taps' `ConstOffset`. The site keeps the gradients (no implicit derivative
//! crosses a call), the word's test, the plain arm and the texel's conversion of the sum. An
//! extended-range sample's call passes its coordinate, the array layer and the level its mip
//! filter reads at (an explicit level, or the level of detail its site takes from derivatives or
//! gradients), and its constant texel offset, which the routine places on each lane, so the
//! samples at every offset call one routine; the site keeps the result's status word.
//!
//! **Not routines.** A heap image's sample (an argument buffer's), whose `NonUniform` handle a
//! call would carry (a later step's check); an extended-range sample on a profile whose driver is
//! not known to keep a `DontInline` call a call (`extended::Sample::routine`), where the routine
//! measured slower to make than the site code; a switch-at-use's shared emulation
//! (`sampler::shared_value`), which runs once already; a gather's fetches; an anisotropic sample
//! at a dynamic texel offset on a profile without the `Offset` operand on a sample, whose arms its
//! site's access reads; and the bicubic filter's site code.
//!
//! **The call's control.** A sampling routine is started by
//! `ModuleBuilder::sampling_routine`: `DontInline` where the profile states that its driver keeps
//! such a call a call (`DriverWorkaround::DontInlineKeepsCalls`, a cost fact keyed on the driver
//! release and GPU measured) or that it inlines every function at each call
//! (`DriverWorkaround::FunctionsInlinedAtEveryCall`, MoltenVK's); no control elsewhere, the
//! default, whose code and answers are the same. Mesa's drivers inline every function whatever it
//! states, so there the module is smaller and the pipeline the same.
//!
//! **Census**. An extended-range sample's routine is counted once per shape the plan notes
//! ([`note_extended`], `sampler::routine_words`), under `sampler.extended_range.routine`
//! (`extended::Sample::words` its site's). The census counts no anisotropic emulation, at its
//! sites or in a routine.
