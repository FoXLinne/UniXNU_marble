//! Whether a function may store through the object bound at one of its argument-table slots.
//!
//! The question a consumer asks of a state it is about to bind resources to: *may this function
//! write the object at this slot?* A slot the function cannot store through holds a resource no
//! draw or dispatch of the state can dirty, so a read-only buffer may sit there.
//!
//! It is answered from the entry's AIR metadata ABI alone: each parameter's role, the access its
//! declaration states (`air.read`, `air.write`, `air.read_write`, `air.sample`) and the slot it
//! binds (`air.location_index`). The declared access is the whole of it; the address space beside
//! it (`air.address_space`) is not read, and needs not be, since Apple's compiler writes
//! `air.read` for a `constant` or `const device` buffer and `air.read_write` for a `device` one.
//!
//! It is the same field the reflection derives [`Binding::access`](super::Binding::access) from,
//! so the two answers agree by construction, and
//! `writes_tests::every_fixture_kernel_answers_and_agrees_with_its_reflection` holds them
//! together over the recorded fixtures. The values are Metal's `MTLBinding.access` (the
//! measurements are
//! [`reflection`](super)'s): a `device` buffer is read-write whether the function reads it, writes
//! it or both; a `constant` or `const device` buffer is read-only; a texture read or sampled is
//! read-only, one written write-only, one `read_write` read-write; samplers, function tables,
//! acceleration structures and imageblocks are read-only; threadgroup memory is read-write; an
//! object function's payload is read-write and a mesh function's read-only.
//!
//! It derives **no type description**: not a pointee's data type, struct members, array strides,
//! sizes or alignments. That is the whole difference from a reflection, and the reason this
//! question is answerable where a reflection is refused. A reflection must give Metal's
//! `MTLType` for every binding, and refuses the function where Metal's answer for one argument's
//! *type* has not been measured (an argument buffer's member the AIR gives no argument index, a
//! pipeline's stride for an array of structs holding a struct, a type name the data-type table
//! does not know). None of those describe an access, so none of them need stop this answer: a
//! function whose reflection is refused still states, for every argument, what it may do to it.
//!
//! So a state that compiles always answers, and the answer is per slot: an argument whose own
//! access or slot cannot be determined is one [`SlotWrite`], naming the parameter and the
//! [`SlotWriteGap`] that left it undetermined, and the other arguments keep their answers. No
//! uncertainty is spread over the rest of the state, and an undetermined slot never reads as
//! writable nor as not writable: [`SlotWrite::may_write`] answers
//! [`SlotWritability::Unknown`] for it.
