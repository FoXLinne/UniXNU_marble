//! A two-plane YCbCr texture's planes read in place: a function reads the codes from the planes'
//! own bytes and converts each texel as Metal does, where the texture's image of converted texels
//! (`ycbcr_convert`) would otherwise stand between them.
//!
//! **What it covers.** `YCBCR8_420_2P` and `YCBCR10_420_2P` (500 and 505) over a surface's two
//! planes, read converted ([`YCbCrOutput::Converted`]): the 4:2:0 layouts of unpacked codes, a
//! byte or the high 10 bits of a little-endian 16-bit word. A texture whose planes are those
//! ([`YCbCrInPlace::of`]) states it in its facts (`TextureFacts::ycbcr_in_place`), and a texture
//! slot whose function reads it only as the in-place form reads
//! (`RuntimeFact::YCbCrInPlace`) takes the slot's in-place variant (`VariantKey::ycbcr_in_place`).
//!
//! **The binding.** The slot's one descriptor is a uniform texel buffer over the planes' bytes,
//! from the first byte of the first plane in memory, in [`YCbCrInPlace::format`]: `R8G8_UINT`
//! for 8-bit codes and `R16G16_UINT` for 10-bit ones, so one element holds two luma codes or one
//! chroma pair. Vulkan requires `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT` of both formats on
//! every device (the specification's "Required Format Support": `R8G8_UINT` in "1-3 Byte-Sized
//! Components", `R16G16_UINT` in "16-bit Components"). The texture's size, its planes' places
//! and rows in elements, and its conversion are the slot's push field
//! (`PushField::YCbCrInPlace`, [`YCbCrInPlace::words`]).
//!
//! **What a function reads** is Metal's texel (`ycbcr_convert`'s module docs): the luma code at
//! the texel's place, the four nearest chroma pairs weighted 9/3/3/1 and rounded to a code, and
//! the conversion of the surface's range and matrix, each channel a step of `1 / 2048`, alpha 1.
//! A sample is Metal's filter of those texels on that grid (`lower::sampler::in_place`), exact,
//! as the image's emulated filter is.
//!
//! **Through the device's sampler.** Where the consumer also holds the planes as an image of the
//! multi-planar 4:2:0 format over their own bytes, which the device's sampler Y′CbCr conversion
//! reads with Metal's reconstruction (the chroma at the midpoint through a linear chroma filter),
//! the texture states it ([`YCbCrInPlace::with_planes_image`]), and a slot whose every sample the
//! device's sampler takes (`RuntimeFact::YCbCrInPlace`'s `device`: no border address mode, no
//! texel offset placed by a parent's size) samples that image instead
//! (`VariantKey::ycbcr_planes_sampled`): its binding a combined image sampler whose immutable
//! sampler bakes the conversion ([`YCbCrPlanesSampler`], `ResourceKind::YCbCrPlanes`), each sample
//! the device's at level 0, a nearest one at the centre of the luma texel Metal reads. Its answer
//! is the device's conversion and filter of the codes, not Metal's.
