//! The index gather pass: the lists of a run of draws whose primitives follow from their
//! positions alone, written by one dispatch for every draw of the run, where the index rewrite
//! pass takes three dispatches per draw (the parent module). A run holds direct indexed draws of a
//! program that never restarts ([`RewriteProgram::gathers`]: line and triangle lists, Apple's
//! triangle fan and quads) over one index buffer, or indirect draws over one arguments buffer:
//! indexed ones of such a program over one index buffer, or ones without indices of any program
//! but a line loop ([`RewriteProgram::gathers_without_indices`]), whose positions never restart.
//! Such a draw's list is its positions' list ([`RewriteProgram::sequential_list`] in the draw's
//! order, whose start is the list of a draw of fewer positions) with each position read as the
//! fetch reads it: its index where it lies inside the buffer's whole indices from the draw's
//! offset, else 0; a draw without indices, the position itself. That is the list the rewrite pass
//! writes for the draw, index for index.
//!
//! - **The pattern** ([`IndexGatherModule::PATTERN_BINDING`], [`IndexGather::pattern`]): the
//!   positions' list in closed form, which every draw of the run reads from its start: its period
//!   `P` (word 0), then `P` multipliers and `P` addends, the list's index `o` being the position
//!   `mult[o % P] * (o / P) + add[o % P]` ([`RewriteProgram::gather_pattern`]).
//! - **The table** ([`IndexGather::table`], a storage buffer at
//!   [`IndexGatherModule::TABLE_BINDING`]): [`IndexGatherModule::HEADER_WORDS`] words of header,
//!   then one record of [`IndexGatherModule::RECORD_WORDS`] words per draw.
//!
//!   | Header word | Written by | Contents |
//!   |---|---|---|
//!   | 0 | the consumer | the run's draws |
//!   | 1 | the consumer | 1 where its draws have no indices, else 0 |
//!   | 2 | the consumer (direct), the plan (indirect) | the run's workgroups |
//!   | 3 | the consumer | an indirect run's: the index pool's index bytes |
//!   | 4 to 6 | the plan | an indirect run's: the dispatch's `VkDispatchIndirectCommand` ([`IndexGather::DISPATCH_OFFSET`]) |
//!   | 7 to 9 | the consumer | an indirect run's: its program's terms of a list's indices from Metal's count `n`, `per * ((n - lead) / step)` ([`RewriteProgram::capacity_terms`]): `lead`, `step`, `per` |
//!
//!   | Record word | Written by | Contents |
//!   |---|---|---|
//!   | 0 | the consumer (direct), the plan (indirect) | the draw's first workgroup |
//!   | 1 | the consumer, the plan | its list's indices |
//!   | 2 | the consumer, the plan | its list's first word in the output |
//!   | 3 | the consumer | its index offset's byte in the bound indices range |
//!   | 4 | the consumer | its whole indices from the offset (saturated to `u32`) |
//!   | 5 | the consumer | 1 for 32-bit indices |
//!   | 6 | the plan | an indirect draw's first index (Metal's `indexStart`), 0 without indices |
//!   | 7 | the consumer | an indirect draw's arguments' first word in the bound arguments range |
//!
//! - **The dispatch**: workgroups of [`IndexGatherModule::LOCAL_SIZE`] invocations over the run's
//!   workgroups (header word 2), each draw's list over workgroups of its own from its first; a
//!   workgroup finds its draw by its first workgroup (a binary search of the records), and each
//!   invocation writes one index of its draw's list. A dispatch of fewer workgroups takes the
//!   run's workgroups in turn: its own index's, then each the dispatch's workgroups past it.
//! - **An indirect run** is planned first: the plan ([`plan::index_gather_plan_module`], one
//!   workgroup) reads each draw's Metal arguments, reserves its list in the command buffer's index
//!   pool (the index bounds pass's, `index_bounds.rs`), and writes its record, the run's
//!   workgroups and dispatch, and each draw's `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand`
//!   ([`plan::IndexGatherPlanModule`]); the gather then dispatches indirectly from the table's
//!   [`IndexGather::DISPATCH_OFFSET`], its output the whole pool.
//! - **Bindings** (set 0, storage buffers): the table, the pattern, the indices
//!   ([`IndexGather::indices_range`]: the index buffer's bytes the consumer names, so one binding
//!   serves every draw of the run; any 4 bytes where it is `None`) and the output (a direct run's
//!   own, or the whole pool). Every read is contained (a word past the bound range reads 0), and
//!   every write lies inside the output.
//! - **Synchronization** (consumer): the indices' writes and the table's upload → `SHADER_READ`
//!   in `COMPUTE_SHADER` before the dispatch (an indirect run's plan before it, its writes →
//!   `SHADER_READ` in `COMPUTE_SHADER` and `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` in `DRAW_INDIRECT`); its
//!   `SHADER_WRITE` → `INDEX_READ` in `INDEX_INPUT` before the draws (and the plan's →
//!   `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` in `DRAW_INDIRECT`).
