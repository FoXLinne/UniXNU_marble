//! The index rewrite pass of a draw whose primitives Vulkan's input assembly does not form as
//! Metal does: one dispatch before the render pass instance reads the draw's Metal indices (or,
//! for an indirect draw without indices, its count) and writes the primitives Metal draws as a
//! list of 32-bit indices, which the draw then draws as a list over its arguments, with primitive
//! restart off.
//!
//! The programs ([`RewriteProgram`], a closed enum: another way of forming primitives from indices
//! is another arm of the same pass, not another pass):
//!
//! - an indexed strip after Apple's `setPrimitiveRestartEnabled:index:`, which restarts at the
//!   call's index `k'` alone, where Vulkan restarts at the index type's all-ones index alone: the
//!   strip's pieces between restarts, each triangle in Vulkan's strip order with its parity
//!   counted from its piece's start (a line strip's segments as pairs), in order, so every
//!   primitive keeps its winding, its provoking vertex and its place in `primitive_id`'s count,
//!   which Metal counts on across a restart (probe 5's `prim_*`). The all-ones index, where it is
//!   not `k'`, is drawn as a vertex;
//! - Apple's private primitive types 5 to 8, which Vulkan has no topology for: a line loop, a
//!   triangle fan, quads and a quad strip, each the list [`RewriteProgram`]'s arms state, in the
//!   order Metal draws it (Metal probes on the M3 Max, macOS 27.0.1): each list primitive's first
//!   vertex is the one Metal's provoking vertex mode 0 takes its flat inputs from, its last the
//!   one mode 1 takes them from, and its order the barycentric order Metal gives at either mode.
//!   The line loop, fan and quads never restart, drawing every index as a vertex; the quad strip
//!   restarts as the strips do, at `k'` (the consumer's restart index: the index type's all-ones
//!   index where the encoder made no call), each piece pairing from its own start. Metal counts
//!   one `primitive_id` per quad, where the list has two triangles: that count is the consumer's.
//! - a line or triangle list ([`RewriteProgram::LineList`], [`RewriteProgram::TriangleList`]),
//!   which never restarts: its primitives in their own order, which a draw under Apple's
//!   `setProvokingVertexMode:` with the last vertex writes in [`RewriteOrder::LastFirst`].
//!
//! **The order** ([`RewriteOrder`], parameter word 14): each primitive in Metal's order at
//! provoking vertex mode 0, the first vertex (the default); in Metal's order at mode 1, the last
//! vertex, which differs only for a triangle strip's odd triangle, `(i + 1, i, i + 2)` where mode 0
//! gives `(i, i + 2, i + 1)` (Metal probes on the M3 Max, macOS 27.0.1: the Vulkan
//! specification's last-vertex strip order); or in Metal's order at mode 1 with the last vertex
//! moved first, `(c, a, b)` of a triangle `(a, b, c)` and `(b, a)` of a line `(a, b)`, so a
//! first-vertex pipeline takes its flat inputs from Metal's provoking vertex.
//!
//! - **Three dispatches** ([`RewritePhase`]) of workgroups of [`IndexRewriteModule::LOCAL_SIZE`]
//!   invocations. The draw's positions are split into one run per invocation of
//!   [`IndexRewritePass::groups`] workgroups. A position completes a step where neither it nor
//!   the [`RewriteProgram::span`] less one positions before it restarts (quads: at every fourth
//!   position; a quad strip: at every second position of its piece), which a run decides from its
//!   own positions and the three before it, so the runs are independent but for two sums over
//!   the runs before each: its primitives (its first primitive's place in the output) and the
//!   start of the piece it begins in (the position after the last restart before it, from which a
//!   triangle's parity and a quad strip's pairs count). A quad strip's run counts its primitives
//!   for both parities of its first piece's positions before it, and the sums take the one the
//!   piece's start gives. [`RewritePhase::Count`] sums each group's runs;
//!   [`RewritePhase::Place`], one workgroup, places each group, reserves the output and writes
//!   the draw; [`RewritePhase::Write`] places each run within its group and writes its
//!   primitives. Each run walks a few dozen positions of a million-position draw, so the walks
//!   spread over the GPU: one workgroup walking every position (the first pass) took 56 ms for a
//!   million positions on an M4.
//! - **Positions** are Metal's: from the arguments' first index, each position inside the
//!   buffer's whole indices from the offset at its index, each past them at index 0, as the fetch
//!   reads it, restart included. Past the buffer every position reads 0, so the walk stops
//!   [`RewriteProgram::span`] positions past the last whole index inside; the rest of the draw's
//!   positions either all restart (`k'` = 0 of a restarting program: no primitive) or complete
//!   primitives of index 0 (a fan's of its first index and two 0s), written without a walk; a line
//!   loop's last segment, from its last position to its first, follows them. A draw without
//!   indices ([`RewriteSource::IndirectVertices`]) reads each position as its own index, walks
//!   them all, and restarts nowhere.
//! - **The output** is either the draw's own region ([`RewriteOutput::Owned`], a direct draw:
//!   its capacity [`RewriteProgram::capacity`] of its count, from index 0), or a reservation in
//!   the command buffer's index pool ([`RewriteOutput::Pooled`], an indirect draw, whose count
//!   only the GPU knows), shared with the index bounds pass (`index_bounds.rs`): the pool's
//!   counter in its first word, bytes reserved from its index region, which starts
//!   [`IndexRewritePass::POOL_HEADER_BYTES`] in. A draw whose primitives its output cannot hold
//!   draws nothing and sets [`StatusBits::INDEX_POOL_OVERFLOW`], which the consumer reports as the
//!   command buffer's error. Nothing is drawn short silently. Of a pooled output, the count
//!   dispatch reads nothing, the place dispatch reads and writes only the counter, and the write
//!   dispatch writes only index bytes, so a consumer may bind the counter for the first two and
//!   another buffer of the pool's bytes for the write, as the index bounds pass's plan and fill
//!   may.
//!
//! **The rewrite words** (one `u32` array of [`IndexRewritePass::BYTES`], a storage buffer, and
//! the indirect source of the draw):
//!
//! | Words | Written by | Contents |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 to 7 | the consumer | [`IndexRewritePass::parameters`]: the arguments' first word in the bound arguments range plus 1 (0 for a direct draw), the index offset's byte in the bound indices range, the whole indices from the offset (saturated to `u32`), 1 for 32-bit indices, `k'`, the output's capacity in indices (owned) or the pool's index bytes (pooled), 1 where pooled, the groups |
//! | 8 to 12 | the consumer | a direct draw's Metal arguments (`MTLDrawIndexedPrimitivesIndirectArguments`: count, instances, first index 0, base vertex, base instance); 0 for an indirect draw, whose arguments are read from the Metal buffer |
//! | 13 | the consumer | 1 for a draw without indices, whose arguments are `MTLDrawPrimitivesIndirectArguments` (count, instances, vertex start, base instance), else 0 |
//! | 14 | the consumer | the order ([`RewriteOrder::word`]): 0 first, 1 last, 2 last first |
//! | 15 | the consumer | 1 for a list drawn in the private list form ([`IndexRewritePass::listed`]): Metal's base vertex in the word before the list, the draw without indices, else 0 |
//! | 16 to 20 | the place dispatch | the draw's `VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` ([`IndexRewritePass::DRAW_OFFSET`]), or in the private list form its `VkDrawIndirectCommand` (the list's indices, instances, its first index's word as first vertex, base instance) and a 0 |
//! | 21 | the place dispatch | the primitives written |
//! | 22 to 25 | the place dispatch | the output's first word, 1 where the draw is written, the primitives before those past the walk, and those past it |
//! | 32 on | the count and place dispatches | three words per group: its primitives (where its first piece's positions before it are even), then those before it; its primitives where they are odd, then the start of the piece it begins in (0 for none); the start of its last piece (0 for none) |
//!
//! **Bindings** (set 0, storage buffers): [`IndexRewriteModule::WORDS_BINDING`],
//! `ARGUMENTS_BINDING` ([`IndexRewritePass::arguments_range`], or any 4 bytes for a direct draw),
//! `INDICES_BINDING` ([`IndexRewritePass::indices_range`], or any 4 bytes where it is `None`),
//! `OUTPUT_BINDING` (the draw's region, or the whole pool from its counter) and `STATUS_BINDING`
//! (the `ExecutionStatus` buffer). Every read of the arguments and indices is contained (an index
//! past the bound range reads 0), and every write lies inside the output.
//!
//! **Synchronization** (consumer): the arguments' and indices' writes and the upload of the
//! words → `SHADER_READ` in `COMPUTE_SHADER` before the count dispatch; each dispatch's
//! `SHADER_WRITE` → `SHADER_READ` and `SHADER_WRITE` in `COMPUTE_SHADER` before the next;
//! passes and index bounds plans one after another (each reads and writes the pool's counter);
//! the write dispatch's writes (and the place dispatch's) → `INDEX_READ` in `INDEX_INPUT` and
//! `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` in `DRAW_INDIRECT` before the draw.
//!
//! **A run** ([`IndexRewriteRun`], [`index_rewrite_run_module`]): direct indexed draws of one
//! program, order and `k'` over one index buffer, each of one group, take one dispatch for all
//! of them, each draw's three phases in turn in a workgroup of its own, its words a slot of the
//! run's and its list a region of the run's output.
