# regen-metal-enums

Generates `crates/metal2vulkan/src/metal/generated.rs`, the Metal enums and option sets of the translator's `metal`
module, and `crates/metal2vulkan-air/src/metal/generated.rs`, the ones the AIR front
end reads (`AIR_ENUMS`: `MTLDataType`, which `metal` re-exports), from the
macOS SDK's `Metal.framework` headers.

Only enumerator names and numeric values are extracted: they are the Metal API's wire contract
(guest command streams and Metal-shaped descriptors carry them as raw ordinals). No header text is
copied. Each listed `NS_ENUM` becomes a `metal_enum!` invocation (a closed Rust enum whose
`TryFrom<u32>` rejects unknown ordinals) and each listed `NS_OPTIONS` a `metal_flags!` invocation
(a bit set whose `TryFrom<u32>` rejects unknown bits); the macros live in `crates/metal2vulkan/src/metal/mod.rs` and,
for the front end's enums, `crates/metal2vulkan-air/src/metal/mod.rs`.
Deprecated spellings with the same value are recorded as aliases. Value expressions other than
integer literals, shifts, ors, and references to earlier enumerators fail generation.

It also generates `scripts/conformance-coverage/metal_enumerators.tsv` from the `TABLE_ONLY` list:
the SDK's enumerators and ordinals for the Metal enums and option sets the tree declares **by
hand** rather than from these headers, because the compile-and-plan layer never reads them. No Rust
is generated for those, and none should be; the table is the conformance suite's option-space
denominator for them, so that a hand-written variant list is measured against the SDK rather than
against itself. One row per name, with `role` saying whether it is the value or a deprecated
spelling of one.

`MTLResourceOptions` is in no list: the SDK writes its values in terms of `MTLCPUCacheMode`'s and
`MTLStorageMode`'s enumerators shifted by `#define`d amounts, which `evaluate` fails on rather than
guessing.

The output records the SDK version it came from, so `--check` passes only against that SDK. To add
a type, append its Metal name to `ENUMS`, `AIR_ENUMS`, `OPTIONS` or `TABLE_ONLY` and regenerate.
Never hand-edit the output.

```sh
# regenerate from the active Xcode SDK (xcrun), or pass --headers DIR --sdk-version V
python3 scripts/regen-metal-enums/regen_metal_enums.py
# idempotence: fail if a committed file differs from a fresh generation
python3 scripts/regen-metal-enums/regen_metal_enums.py --check
# generator unit tests (no SDK needed)
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/regen-metal-enums
```

Requires macOS with Xcode (or the Command Line Tools SDK) and Python 3.
