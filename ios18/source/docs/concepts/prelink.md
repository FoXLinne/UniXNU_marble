# Kernel prelink

The prelinked kernel combines a kernel built from source with the original Apple kernelcache. The source kernel provides the code that UniXNU changes. The original kernelcache provides the Apple kexts and platform services, which the source tree leaves to the kernelcache.

## Inputs

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Native kernel | `out/<device>/<os_profile>/<config>/tree/build/xnu/ios-obj/DEVELOPMENT_ARM64_BCM2837/mach.development.bcm2837.unstripped.noctf` |
| Original kernelcache | IPSW `KernelCache`, or `--kernelcache FILE` |
| Component list | `[kernel.prelink] roots` |
| Slide | `[kernel.prelink] slide` |
| Early security initializer | `[kernel.prelink] early_security_init` |

The kernelcache is the LZFSE payload of the `KernelCache` IM4P. The arm64 slice is selected and checked against `kernelcache_sha256`.

## Prelink steps

`kits/XnuPrelink/emit_prelink.py` performs these steps:

1. Parse the native and original Mach-O images.
2. Read `__PRELINK_INFO` from the original kernelcache.
3. Select the components named in `roots` plus the kernel interfaces they import.
4. Copy the selected component segments into the native kernel's empty coalesced segments.
5. Rebind every pointer that references a selected component.
6. Apply the slide to every selected address.
7. Rewrite the module headers and kmod entries.
8. Build a sparse prelink index.
9. Write `kernel.macho`.

The output keeps the original component code unchanged. The native kernel supplies the platform code, the CPU code, the storage code and the device drivers selected in the defconfig.

## Coalesced segments

The original kernelcache places kext segments in coalesced ranges:

| Original segment | Native segment |
| --- | --- |
| `__PRELINK_TEXT` | `__TEXT` |
| `__PLK_TEXT_EXEC` | `__TEXT_EXEC` |
| `__PLK_DATA_CONST` | `__DATA_CONST` |
| `__PRELINK_DATA` | `__DATA` |

The prelink copies each component segment into the matching range. The ranges keep their original virtual addresses, so pointers inside the original code stay valid after the slide.

## Pointer rebinding

The native kernel imports symbols from the original components. The prelink resolves each import to the component export and writes the slid address at the import site.

The plan records every binding:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    { "new_site": "0xfffffff007123456", "new_target": "0xfffffff004abcdef" }
  ]
}
```

The report is written next to the output. It also records the component list, the instruction inventory and the module entry points.

## Early security initialization

`early_security_init` selects an original security extension and an address in its executable segment. The prelink slides the address and records it for the kernel's early security path. The selected component must carry `AppleSecurityExtension = true` in the prelink metadata.

## Kernelcache pin

A board can pin the kernelcache:

```toml
[kernel.prelink]
kernelcache_sha256 = "..."
```

The prelink refuses a different kernelcache. This ties the native kernel to the original component ABI it was qualified against.

## Sparsity and capacity

The prelink emits a sparse index. The kernel patch `native-4k-bootstrap-capacity` increases the bootstrap page table capacity for native 4 KiB mappings. The boot progress patch adds checkpoint output around the prelink path.

## Report

`emit_prelink.py` writes a JSON report next to the output:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `components` | Original bundle identifiers included |
| `kernel_interfaces` | Components that export kernel interfaces |
| `bindings` | Import sites and slid targets |
| `instruction_inventory` | PC-relative encodings and inline data |
| `module_entrypoints` | Module load addresses after the slide |
| `early_security_initializers` | Selected early initializer addresses |
